      "Lodging in the same house with her, he had noticed too, how orderly she\n",

      "presumably, and without the complexion or the allurement of Miss Doyle\n",
      "certainly, but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to\n",

      "The jacmanna was bright violet; the wall staring white. She would not\n",

      "Mr. Paunceforte's visit, to see everything pale, elegant, semitransparent.\n",
      "Then beneath the colour there was the shape. She could see it all so\n",
      "clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush\n",
      "in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment's flight\n",
      "between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often\n",
      "brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to\n",
      "work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child. Such she often\n",
      "felt herself--struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to\n",
      "say: \"But this is what I see; this is what I see,\" and so to clasp some\n",
      "miserable remnant of her vision to her breast, which a thousand forces did\n",
      "their best to pluck from her. And it was then too, in that chill and\n",
      "windy way, as she began to paint, that there forced themselves upon her\n",
      "other things, her own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for\n",
      "her father off the Brompton Road, and had much ado to control her impulse\n",
      "to fling herself (thank Heaven she had always resisted so far) at\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay's knee and say to her--but what could one say to her? \"I'm in\n",

      "waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children. It was\n",
      "absurd, it was impossible. So now she laid her brushes neatly in the box,\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Bankes liked her for bidding him \"think of his work.\" He had thought\n",
      "of it, often and often. Times without number, he had said, \"Ramsay is one\n",
      "of those men who do their best work before they are forty.\" He had made a\n",
      "definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was only\n",
      "five and twenty; what came after was more or less amplification,\n",
      "repetition. But the number of men who make a definite contribution to\n",
      "anything whatsoever is very small, he said, pausing by the pear tree, well\n",
      "brushed, scrupulously exact, exquisitely judicial. Suddenly, as if the\n",
      "movement of his hand had released it, the load of her accumulated\n",
      "impressions of him tilted up, and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all\n",
      "she felt about him. That was one sensation. Then up rose in a fume the\n",
      "essence of his being. That was another. She felt herself transfixed\n",
      "by the intensity of her perception; it was his severity; his goodness. I\n",
      "respect you (she addressed silently him in person) in every atom; you are\n",
      "not vain; you are entirely impersonal; you are finer than Mr. Ramsay; you\n",

      "all? Standing now, apparently transfixed, by the pear tree, impressions\n",
      "poured in upon her of those two men, and to follow her thought was like\n",
      "following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one's\n",
      "pencil, and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting\n",
      "undeniable, everlasting, contradictory things, so that even the\n",
      "fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably\n",
      "fixed there for eternity. You have greatness, she continued, but\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay has none of it. He is petty, selfish, vain, egotistical; he is\n",
      "spoilt; he is a tyrant; he wears Mrs. Ramsay to death; but he has what you\n",

      "exploded of its own intensity; she felt released; a shot went off close at\n",

      "of peevish shame, their normal gaze, as if he begged them to withhold for\n",

      "discovery was not to be routed utterly, but was determined to hold fast to\n",
      "something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was\n",
      "ashamed, but in which he revelled--he turned abruptly, slammed his private\n",
      "door on them; and, Lily Briscoe and Mr. Bankes, looking uneasily up into\n",
      "the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which Jasper had routed with\n",

      "here all through the winter when the house, with only one old woman to see\n",
      "to it, positively dripped with wet? Never mind, the rent was precisely\n",

      "three thousand, or if she must be accurate, three hundred miles from his\n",
      "libraries and his lectures and his disciples; and there was room for\n",
      "visitors. Mats, camp beds, crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose London\n",
      "life of service was done--they did well enough here; and a photograph or\n",
      "two, and books. Books, she thought, grew of themselves. She never had\n",

      "dreamt of, more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring\n",
      "and, as she sat in the wicker arm-chair in the drawing-room window she\n",
      "wore, to Lily's eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome.\n",
      "\n",
      "This ray passed level with Mr. Bankes's ray straight to Mrs. Ramsay sitting\n",
      "reading there with James at her knee. But now while she still looked,\n",
      "Mr. Bankes had done. He had put on his spectacles. He had stepped back.\n",
      "He had raised his hand. He had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes,\n",
      "when Lily, rousing herself, saw what he was at, and winced like a dog who\n",
      "sees a hand raised to strike it. She would have snatched her picture off\n",
      "the easel, but she said to herself, One must. She braced herself to stand\n",
      "the awful trial of some one looking at her picture. One must, she said,\n",
      "one must. And if it must be seen, Mr. Bankes was less alarming than\n",
      "another. But that any other eyes should see the residue of her\n",
      "thirty-three years, the deposit of each day's living mixed with something\n",
      "more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those\n",
      "days was an agony. At the same time it was immensely exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be cooler and quieter. Taking out a pen-knife, Mr. Bankes\n",
      "tapped the canvas with the bone handle. What did she wish to indicate by\n",
      "the triangular purple shape, \"just there\"? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Mrs. Ramsay reading to James, she said. She knew his objection--\n",
      "that no one could tell it for a human shape. But she had made no attempt\n",
      "at likeness, she said. For what reason had she introduced them then? he\n",
      "asked. Why indeed?--except that if there, in that corner, it was bright,\n",
      "here, in this, she felt the need of darkness. Simple, obvious,\n",
      "commonplace, as it was, Mr. Bankes was interested. Mother and child\n",
      "then--objects of universal veneration, and in this case the mother was\n",
      "famous for her beauty--might be reduced, he pondered, to a purple shadow\n",
      "without irreverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the picture was not of them, she said. Or, not in his sense. There\n",
      "were other senses too in which one might reverence them. By a shadow here\n",
      "and a light there, for instance. Her tribute took that form if, as she\n",
      "vaguely supposed, a picture must be a tribute. A mother and child might\n",
      "be reduced to a shadow without irreverence. A light here required a\n",
      "shadow there. He considered. He was interested. He took it\n",
      "scientifically in complete good faith. The truth was that all his\n",
      "prejudices were on the other side, he explained. The largest picture in\n",
      "his drawing-room, which painters had praised, and valued at a higher price\n",
      "than he had given for it, was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks\n",
      "of the Kennet. He had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the Kennet, he\n",
      "said. Lily must come and see that picture, he said. But now--he turned,\n",
      "with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas. The\n",
      "question being one of the relations of masses, of lights and shadows,\n",
      "which, to be honest, he had never considered before, he would like to have\n",
      "it explained--what then did she wish to make of it? And he indicated the\n",
      "scene before them. She looked. She could not show him what she wished to\n",
      "make of it, could not see it even herself, without a brush in her hand.\n",
      "She took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the\n",
      "absent-minded manner, subduing all her impressions as a woman to something\n",
      "much more general; becoming once more under the power of that vision which\n",
      "she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses\n",
      "and mothers and children--her picture. It was a question, she remembered,\n",
      "how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left. She\n",
      "might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so; or break the\n",
      "vacancy in the foreground by an object (James perhaps) so. But the danger\n",
      "was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken. She\n",
      "stopped; she did not want to bore him; she took the canvas lightly off the\n",
      "easel.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it had been seen; it had been taken from her. This man had shared\n",
      "with her something profoundly intimate. And, thanking Mr. Ramsay for it\n",
      "and Mrs. Ramsay for it and the hour and the place, crediting the world with\n",
      "a power which she had not suspected--that one could walk away down that\n",
      "long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody--the\n",
      "strangest feeling in the world, and the most exhilarating--she nicked\n",
      "the catch of her paint-box to, more firmly than was necessary, and the\n",
      "nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint-box, the lawn,\n",

      "For Cam grazed the easel by an inch; she would not stop for Mr. Bankes\n",
      "and Lily Briscoe; though Mr. Bankes, who would have liked a daughter of\n",
      "his own, held out his hand; she would not stop for her father, whom she\n",
      "grazed also by an inch; nor for her mother, who called \"Cam! I want\n",
      "you a moment!\" as she dashed past. She was off like a bird, bullet, or\n",
      "arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by whom, at what directed, who\n",
      "could say? What, what? Mrs. Ramsay pondered, watching her. It might\n",
      "be a vision--of a shell, of a wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the\n",
      "far side of the hedge; or it might be the glory of speed; no one knew.\n",

      "What was she dreaming about, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, seeing her engrossed,\n",
      "as she stood there, with some thought of her own, so that she had to\n",
      "repeat the message twice--ask Mildred if Andrew, Miss Doyle, and Mr.\n",

      "make Heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child's mind. What\n",
      "message would Cam give the cook? Mrs. Ramsay wondered. And indeed it\n",
      "was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in\n",
      "the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up\n",

      "waited, in a colourless singsong. Shifting from foot to foot, Cam\n",

      "Andrew would be off after his crabs--but possibly Nancy was with them.\n",
      "She tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after\n",
      "lunch. There they stood, looking at the sky, wondering about the\n",

      "both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and his Wife was\n",
      "like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now and then ran up\n",
      "unexpectedly into the melody. And when should she be told? If nothing\n",
      "happened, she would have to speak seriously to Minta. For she could\n",

      "which, coming back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband.\n",
      "Dear, dear, Mrs. Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this\n",
      "incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her stocking?\n",
      "How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was\n",
      "always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered,\n",
      "and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits--interesting\n",
      "perhaps, but limited after all--of that bird? Naturally, one had asked\n",
      "her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at Finlay, which\n",
      "had resulted in some friction with the Owl, her mother, and more calling,\n",
      "and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had\n",
      "told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said\n",
      "to her husband that night, coming back from the party). However,\n",
      "Minta came...Yes, she came, Mrs. Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn\n",
      "in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a\n",
      "woman had once accused her of \"robbing her of her daughter's affections\";\n",
      "something Mrs. Doyle had said made her remember that charge again. Wishing\n",
      "to dominate, wishing to interfere, making people do what she wished--that\n",
      "was the charge against her, and she thought it most unjust. How could\n",
      "she help being \"like that\" to look at? No one could accuse her of\n",
      "taking pains to impress. She was often ashamed of her own shabbiness.\n",
      "Nor was she domineering, nor was she tyrannical. It was more true\n",
      "about hospitals and drains and the dairy. About things like that she\n",
      "did feel passionately, and would, if she had the chance, have liked to\n",
      "take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see. No\n",
      "hospital on the whole island. It was a disgrace. Milk delivered at\n",
      "your door in London positively brown with dirt. It should be made\n",
      "illegal. A model dairy and a hospital up here--those two things she\n",
      "would have liked to do, herself. But how? With all these children?\n",
      "When they were older, then perhaps she would have time; when they were\n",
      "all at school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, but she never wanted James to grow a day older! or Cam either.\n",
      "These two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were,\n",
      "demons of wickedness, angels of delight, never to see them grow up into\n",
      "long-legged monsters. Nothing made up up for the loss. When she read\n",
      "just now to James, \"and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums\n",
      "and trumpets,\" and his eyes darkened, she thought, why should they grow\n",
      "up and lose all that? He was the most gifted, the most sensitive of\n",
      "her children. But all, she thought, were full of promise. Prue, a\n",
      "perfect angel with the others, and sometimes now, at night especially,\n",
      "she took one's breath away with her beauty. Andrew--even her husband\n",
      "admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary. And Nancy\n",
      "and Roger, they were both wild creatures now, scampering about over the\n",
      "country all day long. As for Rose, her mouth was too big, but she had\n",
      "a wonderful gift with her hands. If they had charades, Rose made the\n",
      "dresses; made everything; liked best arranging tables, flowers,\n",
      "anything. She did not like it that Jasper should shoot birds; but it\n",
      "was only a stage; they all went through stages. Why, she asked,\n",
      "pressing her chin on James's head, should they grow up so fast? Why\n",
      "should they go to school? She would have liked always to have had a\n",
      "baby. She was happiest carrying one in her arms. Then people might\n",
      "say she was tyrannical, domineering, masterful, if they chose; she did\n",
      "not mind. And, touching his hair with her lips, she thought, he will\n",
      "never be so happy again, but stopped herself, remembering how it\n",
      "angered her husband that she should say that. Still, it was true. They\n",
      "were happier now than they would ever be again. A tenpenny tea set\n",
      "made Cam happy for days. She heard them stamping and crowing on the\n",
      "floor above her head the moment they awoke. They came bustling along\n",
      "the passage. Then the door sprang open and in they came, fresh as\n",
      "roses, staring, wide awake, as if this coming into the dining-room\n",
      "after breakfast, which they did every day of their lives, was a\n",
      "positive event to them, and so on, with one thing after another, all\n",
      "day long, until she went up to say good-night to them, and found them\n",
      "netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries, still\n",
      "making up stories about some little bit of rubbish--something they had\n",
      "heard, something they had picked up in the garden. They all had their\n",
      "little treasures... And so she went down and said to her husband, Why\n",
      "must they grow up and lose it all? Never will they be so happy again.\n",
      "And he was angry. Why take such a gloomy view of life? he said. It\n",
      "is not sensible. For it was odd; and she believed it to be true; that\n",
      "with all his gloom and desperation he was happier, more hopeful on the\n",
      "whole, than she was. Less exposed to human worries--perhaps that was\n",
      "it. He had always his work to fall back on. Not that she herself was\n",
      "\"pessimistic,\" as he accused her of being. Only she thought life--and\n",
      "a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes--her fifty\n",
      "years. There it was before her--life. Life, she thought--but she did\n",
      "not finish her thought. She took a look at life, for she had a clear\n",
      "sense of it there, something real, something private, which she shared\n",
      "neither with her children nor with her husband. A sort of transaction\n",
      "went on between them, in which she was on one side, and life was on\n",
      "another, and she was always trying to get the better of it, as it was\n",
      "of her; and sometimes they parleyed (when she sat alone); there were,\n",
      "she remembered, great reconciliation scenes; but for the most part,\n",
      "oddly enough, she must admit that she felt this thing that she called\n",
      "life terrible, hostile, and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a\n",
      "chance. There were eternal problems: suffering; death; the poor. There\n",
      "was always a woman dying of cancer even here. And yet she had said to\n",
      "all these children, You shall go through it all. To eight people she\n",
      "had said relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be\n",
      "fifty pounds). For that reason, knowing what was before them--love and\n",
      "ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places--she had often the\n",
      "feeling, Why must they grow up and lose it all? And then she said to\n",
      "herself, brandishing her sword at life, Nonsense. They will be\n",
      "perfectly happy. And here she was, she reflected, feeling life rather\n",
      "sinister again, making Minta marry Paul Rayley; because whatever she\n",
      "might feel about her own transaction, she had had experiences which\n",
      "need not happen to every one (she did not name them to herself); she\n",
      "was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost as if it were an escape for\n",
      "her too, to say that people must marry; people must have children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was she wrong in this, she asked herself, reviewing her conduct for the\n",
      "past week or two, and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon\n",
      "Minta, who was only twenty-four, to make up her mind. She was uneasy.\n",
      "Had she not laughed about it? Was she not forgetting again how\n",
      "strongly she influenced people? Marriage needed--oh, all sorts of\n",
      "qualities (the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds); one--she\n",

      "late. The light in the garden told her that; and the whitening of the\n",
      "flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together, to rouse\n",
      "in her a feeling of anxiety. What it was about she could not think at\n",
      "first. Then she remembered; Paul and Minta and Andrew had not come\n",
      "back. She summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in\n",

      "darkness, something invisible to others. Although she continued to\n",
      "knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself; and this self\n",
      "having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures. When\n",
      "life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless.\n",
      "And to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources,\n",
      "she supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus Carmichael, must\n",
      "feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply childish.\n",
      "Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is unfathomably deep;\n",
      "but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us\n",
      "by. Her horizon seemed to her limitless. There were all the places\n",
      "she had not seen; the Indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside the\n",
      "thick leather curtain of a church in Rome. This core of darkness could\n",
      "go anywhere, for no one saw it. They could not stop it, she thought,\n",
      "exulting. There was freedom, there was peace, there was, most\n",
      "welcome of all, a summoning together, a resting on a platform\n",
      "of stability. Not as oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience\n",
      "(she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles) but as a\n",
      "wedge of darkness. Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry,\n",
      "the stir; and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph\n",
      "over life when things came together in this peace, this rest, this\n",
      "eternity; and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the\n",
      "Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which was\n",
      "her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour one\n",
      "could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things\n",
      "one saw; and this thing, the long steady stroke, was her stroke. Often\n",
      "she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and looking, with her\n",
      "work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at--that light,\n",
      "for example. And it would lift up on it some little phrase or other\n",
      "which had been lying in her mind like that--\"Children don't forget,\n",
      "children don't forget\"--which she would repeat and begin adding to it,\n",
      "It will end, it will end, she said. It will come, it will come, when\n",
      "suddenly she added, We are in the hands of the Lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "But instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that. Who had\n",
      "said it? Not she; she had been trapped into saying something she did\n",
      "not mean. She looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and\n",
      "it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes, searching as\n",
      "she alone could search into her mind and her heart, purifying out of\n",
      "existence that lie, any lie. She praised herself in praising the\n",
      "light, without vanity, for she was stern, she was searching, she was\n",
      "beautiful like that light. It was odd, she thought, how if one was\n",
      "alone, one leant to inanimate things; trees, streams, flowers; felt\n",
      "they expressed one; felt they became one; felt they knew one, in a\n",
      "sense were one; felt an irrational tenderness thus (she looked at that\n",
      "long steady light) as for oneself. There rose, and she looked and\n",
      "looked with her needles suspended, there curled up off the floor of the\n",
      "mind, rose from the lake of one's being, a mist, a bride to meet her\n",
      "lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "What brought her to say that: \"We are in the hands of the Lord?\" she\n",
      "wondered. The insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her,\n",
      "annoyed her. She returned to her knitting again. How could any Lord\n",
      "have made this world? she asked. With her mind she had always seized\n",
      "the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but suffering, death,\n",
      "the poor. There was no treachery too base for the world to commit; she\n",
      "knew that. No happiness lasted; she knew that. She knitted with firm\n",
      "composure, slightly pursing her lips and, without being aware of it, so\n",
      "stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness\n",
      "that when her husband passed, though he was chuckling at the thought\n",
      "that Hume, the philosopher, grown enormously fat, had stuck in a bog,\n",
      "he could not help noting, as he passed, the sternness at the heart of\n",
      "her beauty. It saddened him, and her remoteness pained him, and he\n",
      "felt, as he passed, that he could not protect her, and, when he reached\n",
      "the hedge, he was sad. He could do nothing to help her. He must stand\n",
      "by and watch her. Indeed, the infernal truth was, he made things worse\n",
      "for her. He was irritable--he was touchy. He had lost his temper over\n",
      "the Lighthouse. He looked into the hedge, into its intricacy, its\n",
      "darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always, Mrs. Ramsay felt, one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly\n",
      "by laying hold of some little odd or end, some sound, some sight. She\n",
      "listened, but it was all very still; cricket was over; the children\n",
      "were in their baths; there was only the sound of the sea. She stopped\n",
      "knitting; she held the long reddish-brown stocking dangling in her\n",
      "hands a moment. She saw the light again. With some irony in her\n",
      "interrogation, for when one woke at all, one's relations changed, she\n",
      "looked at the steady light, the pitiless, the remorseless, which was so\n",
      "much her, yet so little her, which had her at its beck and call (she\n",
      "woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed, stroking the\n",
      "floor), but for all that she thought, watching it with fascination,\n",
      "hypnotised, as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed\n",
      "vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight, she\n",
      "had known happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it\n",
      "silvered the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and\n",
      "the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which\n",
      "curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in\n",
      "her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and\n",
      "she felt, It is enough! It is enough!\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and saw her. Ah! She was lovely, lovelier now than ever he\n",
      "thought. But he could not speak to her. He could not interrupt her.\n",
      "He wanted urgently to speak to her now that James was gone and she was\n",
      "alone at last. But he resolved, no; he would not interrupt her. She\n",
      "was aloof from him now in her beauty, in her sadness. He would let her\n",
      "be, and he passed her without a word, though it hurt him that she\n",
      "should look so distant, and he could not reach her, he could do nothing\n",
      "to help her. And again he would have passed her without a word had she\n",
      "not, at that very moment, given him of her own free will what she knew\n",
      "he would never ask, and called to him and taken the green shawl off the\n",
      "picture frame, and gone to him. For he wished, she knew, to protect\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "\n",
      "She folded the green shawl about her shoulders. She took his arm. His\n",
      "beauty was so great, she said, beginning to speak of Kennedy the\n",
      "gardener, at once he was so awfully handsome, that she couldn't dismiss\n",
      "him. There was a ladder against the greenhouse, and little lumps of\n",
      "putty stuck about, for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse.\n",
      "Yes, but as she strolled along with her husband, she felt that that\n",
      "particular source of worry had been placed. She had it on the tip of\n",
      "her tongue to say, as they strolled, \"It'll cost fifty pounds,\" but\n",
      "instead, for her heart failed her about money, she talked about Jasper\n",
      "shooting birds, and he said, at once, soothing her instantly, that it\n",
      "was natural in a boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of\n",
      "amusing himself before long. Her husband was so sensible, so just.\n",
      "And so she said, \"Yes; all children go through stages,\" and began\n",
      "considering the dahlias in the big bed, and wondering what about next\n",
      "year's flowers, and had he heard the children's nickname for Charles\n",
      "Tansley, she asked. The atheist, they called him, the little atheist.\n",
      "\"He's not a polished specimen,\" said Mr. Ramsay. \"Far from it,\" said\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay.\n",
      "\n",
      "She supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices, Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs; did\n",
      "they plant them? \"Oh, he has his dissertation to write,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay. She knew all about THAT, said Mrs. Ramsay. He talked of\n",
      "nothing else. It was about the influence of somebody upon something.\n",
      "\"Well, it's all he has to count on,\" said Mr. Ramsay. \"Pray Heaven he\n",
      "won't fall in love with Prue,\" said Mrs. Ramsay. He'd disinherit her if\n",
      "she married him, said Mr. Ramsay. He did not look at the flowers,\n",
      "which his wife was considering, but at a spot about a foot or\n",
      "so above them. There was no harm in him, he added, and was just\n",
      "about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in England who\n",
      "admired his--when he choked it back. He would not bother her again\n",
      "about his books. These flowers seemed creditable, Mr. Ramsay said,\n",
      "lowering his gaze and noticing something red, something brown. Yes, but\n",
      "then these she had put in with her own hands, said Mrs. Ramsay. The\n",
      "question was, what happened if she sent bulbs down; did Kennedy plant\n",
      "them? It was his incurable laziness; she added, moving on. If she\n",
      "stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand, he did sometimes\n",
      "do a stroke of work. So they strolled along, towards the red-hot\n",
      "pokers. \"You're teaching your daughters to exaggerate,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay, reproving her. Her Aunt Camilla was far worse than she was, Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay remarked. \"Nobody ever held up your Aunt Camilla as a model of\n",
      "virtue that I'm aware of,\" said Mr. Ramsay. \"She was the most beautiful\n",
      "woman I ever saw,\" said Mrs. Ramsay. \"Somebody else was that,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay. Prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was, said Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay. He saw no trace of it, said Mr. Ramsay. \"Well, then, look\n",
      "tonight,\" said Mrs. Ramsay. They paused. He wished Andrew could be\n",
      "induced to work harder. He would lose every chance of a scholarship if\n",
      "he didn't. \"Oh, scholarships!\" she said. Mr. Ramsay thought her foolish\n",
      "for saying that, about a serious thing, like a scholarship. He should\n",
      "be very proud of Andrew if he got a scholarship, he said. She would be\n",
      "just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered. They disagreed always\n",
      "about this, but it did not matter. She liked him to believe in\n",
      "scholarships, and he liked her to be proud of Andrew whatever he did.\n",
      "Suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wasn't it late? she asked. They hadn't come home yet. He flicked his\n",
      "watch carelessly open. But it was only just past seven. He held his\n",
      "watch open for a moment, deciding that he would tell her what he had\n",
      "felt on the terrace. To begin with, it was not reasonable to be so\n",
      "nervous. Andrew could look after himself. Then, he wanted to tell her\n",
      "that when he was walking on the terrace just now--here he became\n",
      "uncomfortable, as if he were breaking into that solitude, that\n",
      "aloofness, that remoteness of hers. But she pressed him. What had\n",
      "he wanted to tell her, she asked, thinking it was about going to the\n",
      "Lighthouse; that he was sorry he had said \"Damn you.\" But no. He did\n",
      "not like to see her look so sad, he said. Only wool gathering, she\n",
      "protested, flushing a little. They both felt uncomfortable, as if they\n",
      "did not know whether to go on or go back. She had been reading fairy\n",
      "tales to James, she said. No, they could not share that; they could\n",
      "not say that.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the gap between the two clumps of red-hot pokers, and\n",
      "there was the Lighthouse again, but she would not let herself look at\n",
      "it. Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought, she would\n",
      "not have let herself sit there, thinking. She disliked anything that\n",
      "reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking. So she looked\n",
      "over her shoulder, at the town. The lights were rippling and running\n",
      "as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind. And all the\n",
      "poverty, all the suffering had turned to that, Mrs. Ramsay thought. The\n",
      "lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a\n",
      "phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk. Well, if\n",
      "he could not share her thoughts, Mr. Ramsay said to himself, he would be\n",
      "off, then, on his own. He wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the\n",
      "story how Hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh. But first it\n",
      "was nonsense to be anxious about Andrew. When he was Andrew's age he\n",
      "used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a biscuit\n",
      "in his pocket and nobody bothered about him, or thought that he had\n",
      "fallen over a cliff. He said aloud he thought he would be off for a\n",
      "day's walk if the weather held. He had had about enough of Bankes and\n",
      "of Carmichael. He would like a little solitude. Yes, she said. It\n",
      "annoyed him that she did not protest. She knew that he would never do\n",
      "it. He was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his\n",
      "pocket. She worried about the boys, but not about him. Years ago,\n",
      "before he had married, he thought, looking across the bay, as they\n",
      "stood between the clumps of red-hot pokers, he had walked all day. He\n",
      "had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house. He had worked\n",
      "ten hours at a stretch; an old woman just popped her head in now and\n",
      "again and saw to the fire. That was the country he liked best, over\n",
      "there; those sandhills dwindling away into darkness. One could walk\n",
      "all day without meeting a soul. There was not a house scarcely, not a\n",
      "single village for miles on end. One could worry things out alone.\n",
      "There were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the\n",
      "beginning of time. The seals sat up and looked at you. It sometimes\n",
      "seemed to him that in a little house out there, alone--he broke off,\n",
      "sighing. He had no right. The father of eight children--he reminded\n",
      "himself. And he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single\n",
      "thing altered. Andrew would be a better man than he had been. Prue\n",
      "would be a beauty, her mother said. They would stem the flood a bit.\n",
      "That was a good bit of work on the whole--his eight children. They\n",
      "showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely, for on an\n",
      "evening like this, he thought, looking at the land dwindling away, the\n",
      "little island seemed pathetically small, half swallowed up in the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little place,\" he murmured with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him. He said the most melancholy things, but she noticed\n",
      "that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than\n",
      "usual. All this phrase-making was a game, she thought, for if she had\n",
      "said half what he said, she would have blown her brains out by now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It annoyed her, this phrase-making, and she said to him, in a matter-\n",
      "of-fact way, that it was a perfectly lovely evening. And what was he\n",
      "groaning about, she asked, half laughing, half complaining, for she\n",
      "guessed what he was thinking--he would have written better books if he\n",
      "had not married.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not complaining, he said. She knew that he did not complain.\n",
      "She knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of. And he seized\n",
      "her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that\n",
      "brought the tears to her eyes, and quickly he dropped it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the\n",
      "silver-green spear-like plants grew, arm in arm. His arm was almost\n",
      "like a young man's arm, Mrs. Ramsay thought, thin and hard, and she\n",
      "thought with delight how strong he still was, though he was over sixty,\n",
      "and how untamed and optimistic, and how strange it was that being\n",
      "convinced, as he was, of all sorts of horrors, seemed not to depress\n",
      "him, but to cheer him. Was it not odd, she reflected? Indeed he\n",
      "seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people, born blind,\n",
      "deaf, and dumb, to the ordinary things, but to the extraordinary\n",
      "things, with an eye like an eagle's. His understanding often\n",
      "astonished her. But did he notice the flowers? No. Did he notice the\n",
      "view? No. Did he even notice his own daughter's beauty, or whether\n",
      "there was pudding on his plate or roast beef? He would sit at table\n",
      "with them like a person in a dream. And his habit of talking aloud, or\n",
      "saying poetry aloud, was growing on him, she was afraid; for sometimes\n",
      "it was awkward--\n",

      "against all the silly Giddingses in the world, then, she thought,\n",
      "intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too\n",
      "fast for her, and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were\n",
      "fresh molehills on the bank, then, she thought, stooping down to look,\n",
      "a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours. All\n",
      "the great men she had ever known, she thought, deciding that a rabbit\n",
      "must have got in, were like that, and it was good for young men (though\n",
      "the atmosphere of lecture-rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond\n",
      "endurance almost) simply to hear him, simply to look at him. But\n",
      "without shooting rabbits, how was one to keep them down? she wondered.\n",
      "It might be a rabbit; it might be a mole. Some creature anyhow was\n",
      "ruining her Evening Primroses. And looking up, she saw above the thin\n",
      "trees the first pulse of the full-throbbing star, and wanted to make\n",
      "her husband look at it; for the sight gave her such keen pleasure. But\n",
      "she stopped herself. He never looked at things. If he did, all he\n",
      "would say would be, Poor little world, with one of his sighs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, he said, \"Very fine,\" to please her, and pretended to\n",
      "admire the flowers. But she knew quite well that he did not admire\n",
      "them, or even realise that they were there. It was only to please\n",
      "her. Ah, but was that not Lily Briscoe strolling along with William\n",

      "should--It would be a wonderful experience for her--the Sistine\n",

      "hopelessly discontented with one's own work. Mr. Bankes thought one\n",
      "could carry that point of view too far. We can't all be Titians and we\n",

      "could have your Darwin and your Titian if it weren't for humble people\n",
      "like ourselves. Lily would have liked to pay him a compliment; you're\n",
      "not humble, Mr. Bankes, she would have liked to have said. But he did\n",
      "not want compliments (most men do, she thought), and she was a little\n",
      "ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps\n",
      "what he was saying did not apply to pictures. Anyhow, said Lily,\n",
      "tossing off her little insincerity, she would always go on painting,\n",

      "and, as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she\n",
      "had difficulty in finding subjects in London when they turned and saw\n",

      "tonight,\" meaning that for once Mr. Bankes had agreed to dine with them\n",
      "and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables\n",

      "Prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in\n",

      "(Certainly, Nancy had gone with them, since Minta Doyle had asked it\n",
      "with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as Nancy made off, after\n",
      "lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family life. She\n",
      "supposed she must go then. She did not want to go. She did not want to\n",
      "be drawn into it all. For as they walked along the road to the cliff\n",
      "Minta kept on taking her hand. Then she would let it go. Then she\n",
      "would take it again. What was it she wanted? Nancy asked herself.\n",
      "There was something, of course, that people wanted; for when Minta took\n",
      "her hand and held it, Nancy, reluctantly, saw the whole world spread\n",
      "out beneath her, as if it were Constantinople seen through a mist, and\n",
      "then, however heavy-eyed one might be, one must needs ask, \"Is that\n",
      "Santa Sofia?\" \"Is that the Golden Horn?\" So Nancy asked, when Minta\n",
      "took her hand. \"What is it that she wants? Is it that?\" And what was\n",
      "that? Here and there emerged from the mist (as Nancy looked down upon\n",
      "life spread beneath her) a pinnacle, a dome; prominent things, without\n",
      "names. But when Minta dropped her hand, as she did when they ran down\n",
      "the hillside, all that, the dome, the pinnacle, whatever it was that\n",
      "had protruded through the mist, sank down into it and disappeared.\n",
      "Minta, Andrew observed, was rather a good walker. She wore more\n",
      "sensible clothes that most women. She wore very short skirts and black\n",
      "knickerbockers. She would jump straight into a stream and flounder\n",
      "across. He liked her rashness, but he saw that it would not do--she\n",
      "would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days. She seemed\n",
      "to be afraid of nothing--except bulls. At the mere sight of a bull in\n",
      "a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming, which was the\n",
      "very thing to enrage a bull of course. But she did not mind owning up\n",
      "to it in the least; one must admit that. She knew she was an awful\n",
      "coward about bulls, she said. She thought she must have been tossed in\n",
      "her perambulator when she was a baby. She didn't seem to mind what she\n",
      "said or did. Suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff\n",
      "and began to sing some song about\n",

      "\n",
      "Damn your eyes, damn your eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Damn your eyes, damn your eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "hunting-grounds before they got on to the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fatal,\" Paul agreed, springing up, and as they went slithering down,\n",
      "he kept quoting the guide-book about \"these islands being justly\n",
      "celebrated for their park-like prospects and the extent and variety of\n",
      "their marine curiosities.\" But it would not do altogether, this\n",
      "shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt, picking his way down the\n",
      "cliff, this clapping him on the back, and calling him \"old fellow\" and\n",
      "all that; it would not altogether do. It was the worst of taking women\n",
      "on walks. Once on the beach they separated, he going out on to the\n",
      "Pope's Nose, taking his shoes off, and rolling his socks in them and\n",
      "letting that couple look after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own\n",
      "rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after\n",
      "themselves. She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like\n",
      "sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the\n",
      "rock. Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows\n",
      "into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by\n",
      "holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and\n",
      "desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent\n",
      "creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream\n",
      "down. Out on the pale criss-crossed sand, high-stepping, fringed,\n",
      "gauntleted, stalked some fantastic leviathan (she was still enlarging\n",
      "the pool), and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side.\n",
      "And then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest\n",
      "on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the\n",
      "smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon, she became with all that\n",
      "power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing, hypnotised, and\n",
      "the two senses of that vastness and this tininess (the pool had\n",
      "diminished again) flowering within it made her feel that she was bound\n",
      "hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which\n",
      "reduced her own body, her own life, and the lives of all the people in\n",
      "the world, for ever, to nothingness. So listening to the waves,\n",
      "crouching over the pool, she brooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Andrew shouted that the sea was coming in, so she leapt splashing\n",
      "through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was\n",
      "carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right\n",
      "behind a rock and there--oh, heavens! in each other's arms, were Paul\n",
      "and Minta kissing probably. She was outraged, indignant. She and\n",
      "Andrew put on their shoes and stockings in dead silence without saying\n",
      "a thing about it. Indeed they were rather sharp with each other. She\n",
      "might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was,\n",
      "Andrew grumbled. However, they both felt, it's not our fault. They\n",
      "had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen. All the same it\n",
      "irritated Andrew that Nancy should be a woman, and Nancy that Andrew\n",
      "should be a man, and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the\n",
      "bows rather tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff\n",
      "again that Minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother's brooch--\n",
      "her grandmother's brooch, the sole ornament she possessed--a weeping\n",
      "willow, it was (they must remember it) set in pearls. They must have\n",
      "seen it, she said, with the tears running down her cheeks, the\n",
      "brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the\n",
      "last day of her life. Now she had lost it. She would rather have\n",
      "lost anything than that! She would go back and look for it. They all\n",
      "went back. They poked and peered and looked. They kept their heads\n",
      "very low, and said things shortly and gruffly. Paul Rayley searched\n",
      "like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting. All this\n",
      "pother about a brooch really didn't do at all, Andrew thought, as Paul\n",
      "told him to make a \"thorough search between this point and that.\" The\n",
      "tide was coming in fast. The sea would cover the place where they had\n",
      "sat in a minute. There was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it\n",
      "now. \"We shall be cut off!\" Minta shrieked, suddenly terrified. As if\n",
      "there were any danger of that! It was the same as the bulls all over\n",
      "again--she had no control over her emotions, Andrew thought. Women\n",
      "hadn't. The wretched Paul had to pacify her. The men (Andrew and Paul\n",
      "at once became manly, and different from usual) took counsel briefly\n",
      "and decided that they would plant Rayley's stick where they had sat and\n",
      "come back at low tide again. There was nothing more that could be done\n",
      "now. If the brooch was there, it would still be there in the morning,\n",
      "they assured her, but Minta still sobbed, all the way up to the top of\n",
      "the cliff. It was her grandmother's brooch; she would rather have lost\n",
      "anything but that, and yet Nancy felt, it might be true that she minded\n",
      "losing her brooch, but she wasn't crying only for that. She was crying\n",
      "for something else. We might all sit down and cry, she felt. But she\n",
      "did not know what for.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew ahead together, Paul and Minta, and he comforted her, and\n",
      "said how famous he was for finding things. Once when he was a little\n",
      "boy he had found a gold watch. He would get up at daybreak and he was\n",
      "positive he would find it. It seemed to him that it would be\n",
      "almost dark, and he would be alone on the beach, and somehow it would\n",
      "be rather dangerous. He began telling her, however, that he would\n",
      "certainly find it, and she said that she would not hear of his getting\n",
      "up at dawn: it was lost: she knew that: she had had a presentiment when\n",
      "she put it on that afternoon. And secretly he resolved that he would\n",
      "not tell her, but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were\n",
      "all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to Edinburgh and buy\n",
      "her another, just like it but more beautiful. He would prove what he\n",
      "could do. And as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the\n",
      "town beneath them, the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed\n",
      "like things that were going to happen to him--his marriage, his\n",
      "children, his house; and again he thought, as they came out on to the\n",
      "high road, which was shaded with high bushes, how they would retreat\n",
      "into solitude together, and walk on and on, he always leading her, and\n",
      "she pressing close to his side (as she did now). As they turned by the\n",
      "cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been\n",
      "through, and he must tell some one--Mrs. Ramsay of course, for it took\n",
      "his breath away to think what he had been and done. It had been far\n",
      "and away the worst moment of his life when he asked Minta to marry him.\n",
      "He would go straight to Mrs. Ramsay, because he felt somehow that she\n",
      "was the person who had made him do it. She had made him think he could\n",
      "do anything. Nobody else took him seriously. But she made him believe\n",
      "that he could do whatever he wanted. He had felt her eyes on him all\n",
      "day today, following him about (though she never said a word) as if she\n",
      "were saying, \"Yes, you can do it. I believe in you. I expect it of\n",
      "you.\" She had made him feel all that, and directly they got back (he\n",
      "looked for the lights of the house above the bay) he would go to her\n",
      "and say, \"I've done it, Mrs. Ramsay; thanks to you.\" And so turning into\n",
      "the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the\n",
      "upper windows. They must be awfully late then. People were getting\n",
      "ready for dinner. The house was all lit up, and the lights after the\n",
      "darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself, childishly,\n",
      "as he walked up the drive, Lights, lights, lights, and repeated in a\n",
      "dazed way, Lights, lights, lights, as they came into the house staring\n",
      "about him with his face quite stiff. But, good heavens, he said to\n",
      "himself, putting his hand to his tie, I must not make a fool of\n",
      "myself.)\n",

      "the door (Jasper and Rose came in), whether the fact that Nancy was\n",
      "with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would\n",
      "happen; it made it less likely, somehow, Mrs. Ramsay felt, very\n",
      "irrationally, except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not\n",
      "probable. They could not all be drowned. And again she felt alone in\n",

      "\"Not for the Queen of England,\" said Mrs. Ramsay emphatically.\n",
      "\n",

      "shared his mother's vice: he, too, exaggerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if Rose liked, she said, while Jasper took the message, she might\n",
      "choose which jewels she was to wear. When there are fifteen people\n",
      "sitting down to dinner, one cannot keep things waiting for ever. She\n",
      "was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late; it was\n",
      "inconsiderate of them, and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about\n",
      "them, that they should choose this very night to be out late, when, in\n",
      "fact, she wished the dinner to be particularly nice, since William\n",
      "Bankes had at last consented to dine with them; and they were having\n",
      "Mildred's masterpiece--BOEUF EN DAUBE. Everything depended upon things\n",
      "being served up to the precise moment they were ready. The beef, the\n",
      "bayleaf, and the wine--all must be done to a turn. To keep it waiting\n",
      "was out of the question. Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out\n",
      "they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out,\n",
      "things had to be kept hot; the BOEUF EN DAUBE would be entirely spoilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jasper offered her an opal necklace; Rose a gold necklace. Which\n",
      "looked best against her black dress? Which did indeed, said Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "absent-mindedly, looking at her neck and shoulders (but avoiding her\n",
      "face) in the glass. And then, while the children rummaged among her\n",
      "things, she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused\n",
      "her--the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on. Every time,\n",
      "they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again,\n",
      "because, she thought, the old rook, the father rook, old Joseph was her\n",
      "name for him, was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition.\n",
      "He was a disreputable old bird, with half his wing feathers missing.\n",
      "He was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing\n",
      "the horn in front of a public house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look!\" she said, laughing. They were actually fighting. Joseph and\n",
      "Mary were fighting. Anyhow they all went up again, and the air was\n",
      "shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes.\n",
      "The movements of the wings beating out, out, out--she could never\n",
      "describe it accurately enough to please herself--was one of the\n",
      "loveliest of all to her. Look at that, she said to Rose, hoping\n",
      "that Rose would see it more clearly than she could. For one's children\n",
      "so often gave one's own perceptions a little thrust forwards.\n",
      "\n",

      "dress, for this little ceremony of choosing jewels, which was gone\n",
      "through every night, was what Rose liked best, she knew. She had some\n",
      "hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this\n",
      "choosing what her mother was to wear. What was the reason, Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen,\n",
      "divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite\n",
      "speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at Rose's age. Like\n",
      "all feelings felt for oneself, Mrs. Ramsay thought, it made one sad. It\n",
      "was so inadequate, what one could give in return; and what Rose felt\n",
      "was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was. And Rose\n",
      "would grow up; and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep\n",
      "feelings, and she said she was ready now, and they would go down, and\n",
      "Jasper, because he was the gentleman, should give her his arm, and\n",
      "Rose, as she was the lady, should carry her handkerchief (she gave her\n",
      "the handkerchief), and what else? oh, yes, it might be cold: a shawl.\n",
      "Choose me a shawl, she said, for that would please Rose, who was bound\n",
      "to suffer so. \"There,\" she said, stopping by the window on the\n",
      "landing, \"there they are again.\" Joseph had settled on another tree-\n",
      "top. \"Don't you think they mind,\" she said to Jasper, \"having their\n",
      "wings broken?\" Why did he want to shoot poor old Joseph and Mary? He\n",
      "shuffled a little on the stairs, and felt rebuked, but not seriously,\n",
      "for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds; and they did not\n",
      "feel; and being his mother she lived away in another division of the\n",
      "world, but he rather liked her stories about Mary and Joseph. She made\n",
      "him laugh. But how did she know that those were Mary and Joseph? Did\n",
      "she think the same birds came to the same trees every night? he asked.\n",
      "But here, suddenly, like all grown-up people, she ceased to pay him the\n",
      "least attention. She was listening to a clatter in the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They've come back!\" she exclaimed, and at once she felt much more\n",
      "annoyed with them than relieved. Then she wondered, had it happened?\n",
      "She would go down and they would tell her--but no. They could not tell\n",
      "her anything, with all these people about. So she must go down and\n",
      "begin dinner and wait. And, like some queen who, finding her people\n",
      "gathered in the hall, looks down upon them, and descends among them,\n",
      "and acknowledges their tributes silently, and accepts their devotion\n",
      "and their prostration before her (Paul did not move a muscle but looked\n",
      "straight before him as she passed) she went down, and crossed the hall\n",

      "herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped, the old\n",
      "familiar pulse began beating, as the watch begins ticking--one, two,\n",
      "three, one, two, three. And so on and so on, she repeated, listening\n",
      "to it, sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might\n",
      "guard a weak flame with a news-paper. And so then, she concluded,\n",
      "addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to William\n",
      "Bankes--poor man! who had no wife, and no children and dined alone in\n",
      "lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong\n",
      "enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor\n",
      "not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants\n",
      "to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have\n",

      "them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have\n",
      "sunk beneath the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "How old she looks, how worn she looks, Lily thought, and how remote.\n",
      "Then when she turned to William Bankes, smiling, it was as if the ship\n",
      "had turned and the sun had struck its sails again, and Lily thought\n",
      "with some amusement because she was relieved, Why does she pity him?\n",
      "For that was the impression she gave, when she told him that his\n",
      "letters were in the hall. Poor William Bankes, she seemed to be\n",
      "saying, as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people, and the\n",
      "life in her, her resolve to live again, had been stirred by pity. And\n",
      "it was not true, Lily thought; it was one of those misjudgments of hers\n",
      "that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own\n",
      "rather than of other people's. He is not in the least pitiable. He has\n",
      "his work, Lily said to herself. She remembered, all of a sudden as if\n",
      "she had found a treasure, that she had her work. In a flash she saw\n",
      "her picture, and thought, Yes, I shall put the tree further in the\n",
      "middle; then I shall avoid that awkward space. That's what I shall do.\n",
      "That's what has been puzzling me. She took up the salt cellar and put\n",
      "it down again on a flower pattern in the table-cloth, so as to remind\n",
      "herself to move the tree.\n",
      "\n",

      "as if, Lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to the window\n",
      "precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of\n",
      "his meals. Everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare\n",
      "unloveliness. But nevertheless, the fact remained, it was impossible\n",
      "to dislike any one if one looked at them. She liked his eyes; they\n",
      "were blue, deep set, frightening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you write many letters, Mr. Tansley?\" asked Mrs. Ramsay, pitying him\n",
      "too, Lily supposed; for that was true of Mrs. Ramsay--she pitied men\n",

      "these silly women. He had been reading in his room, and now he came\n",
      "down and it all seemed to him silly, superficial, flimsy. Why did they\n",
      "dress? He had come down in his ordinary clothes. He had not got any\n",
      "dress clothes. \"One never gets anything worth having by post\"--that\n",
      "was the sort of thing they were always saying. They made men say that\n",
      "sort of thing. Yes, it was pretty well true, he thought. They never\n",
      "got anything worth having from one year's end to another. They did\n",
      "nothing but talk, talk, talk, eat, eat, eat. It was the women's fault.\n",

      "that was why he said it? Why did her whole being bow, like corn under\n",
      "a wind, and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great\n",
      "and rather painful effort? She must make it once more. There's the\n",
      "sprig on the table-cloth; there's my painting; I must move the tree to\n",
      "the middle; that matters--nothing else. Could she not hold fast to\n",
      "that, she asked herself, and not lose her temper, and not argue; and if\n",

      "\n",

      "mean to annoy him, for some reason. She was laughing at him. He was in\n",
      "his old flannel trousers. He had no others. He felt very rough and\n",
      "isolated and lonely. He knew that she was trying to tease him for some\n",
      "reason; she didn't want to go to the Lighthouse with him; she despised\n",
      "him: so did Prue Ramsay; so did they all. But he was not going to be\n",
      "made a fool of by women, so he turned deliberately in his chair and\n",
      "looked out of the window and said, all in a jerk, very rudely, it would\n",

      "\n",
      "It annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that, with Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay listening. If only he could be alone in his room working, he\n",
      "thought, among his books. That was where he felt at his ease. And he\n",
      "had never run a penny into debt; he had never cost his father a penny\n",
      "since he was fifteen; he had helped them at home out of his savings; he\n",
      "was educating his sister. Still, he wished he had known how to answer\n",
      "Miss Briscoe properly; he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like\n",
      "that. \"You'd be sick.\" He wished he could think of something to say to\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay, something which would show her that he was not just a dry\n",
      "prig. That was what they all thought him. He turned to her. But Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to William\n",
      "Bankes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, take it away,\" she said briefly, interrupting what she was saying\n",
      "to William Bankes to speak to the maid. \"It must have been fifteen--\n",
      "no, twenty years ago--that I last saw her,\" she was saying, turning\n",
      "back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk, for\n",
      "she was absorbed by what they were saying. So he had actually heard\n",
      "from her this evening! And was Carrie still living at Marlow, and was\n",
      "everything still the same? Oh, she could remember it as if it were\n",
      "yesterday--on the river, feeling it as if it were yesterday--going on\n",
      "the river, feeling very cold. But if the Mannings made a plan they\n",
      "stuck to it. Never should she forget Herbert killing a wasp with a\n",
      "teaspoon on the bank! And it was still going on, Mrs. Ramsay mused,\n",
      "gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing-room\n",
      "on the banks of the Thames where she had been so very, very cold twenty\n",
      "years ago; but now she went among them like a ghost; and it fascinated\n",
      "her, as if, while she had changed, that particular day, now become very\n",
      "still and beautiful, had remained there, all these years. Had Carrie\n",
      "written to him herself? she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. She says they're building a new billiard room,\" he said. No!\n",
      "No! That was out of the question! Building a new billiard room!\n",
      "It seemed to her impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it.\n",
      "They were very well off now. Should he give her love to Carrie?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Ramsay with a little start, \"No,\" she added, reflecting\n",
      "that she did not know this Carrie who built a new billiard room. But\n",
      "how strange, she repeated, to Mr. Bankes's amusement, that they should\n",
      "be going on there still. For it was extraordinary to think that they\n",
      "had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not\n",
      "thought of them more than once all that time. How eventful her own\n",
      "life had been, during those same years. Yet perhaps Carrie Manning\n",
      "had not thought about her, either. The thought was strange and\n",
      "distasteful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People soon drift apart,\" said Mr. Bankes, feeling, however, some\n",
      "satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the Mannings\n",
      "and the Ramsays. He had not drifted apart he thought, laying down his\n",
      "spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips punctiliously. But perhaps he\n",
      "was rather unusual, he thought, in this; he never let himself get into\n",
      "a groove. He had friends in all circles... Mrs. Ramsay had to break\n",
      "off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot. That was\n",
      "why he preferred dining alone. All those interruptions annoyed him.\n",
      "Well, thought William Bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite\n",
      "courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the\n",
      "table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and\n",
      "ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's\n",
      "friends ask of one. It would have hurt her if he had refused to come.\n",
      "But it was not worth it for him. Looking at his hand he thought that\n",
      "if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would\n",
      "have been free to work. Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of\n",
      "time. The children were dropping in still. \"I wish one of you would\n",
      "run up to Roger's room,\" Mrs. Ramsay was saying. How trifling it all\n",
      "is, how boring it all is, he thought, compared with the other thing--\n",
      "work. Here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth when he\n",
      "might have been--he took a flashing bird's-eye view of his work. What\n",
      "a waste of time it all was to be sure! Yet, he thought, she is one of\n",
      "my oldest friends. I am by way of being devoted to her. Yet now, at\n",
      "this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him: her beauty\n",
      "meant nothing to him; her sitting with her little boy at the window--\n",
      "nothing, nothing. He wished only to be alone and to take up that book.\n",
      "He felt uncomfortable; he felt treacherous, that he could sit by her\n",
      "side and feel nothing for her. The truth was that he did not enjoy\n",
      "family life. It was in this sort of state that one asked oneself, What\n",
      "does one live for? Why, one asked oneself, does one take all these\n",
      "pains for the human race to go on? Is it so very desirable? Are we\n",
      "attractive as a species? Not so very, he thought, looking at those\n",
      "rather untidy boys. His favourite, Cam, was in bed, he supposed.\n",
      "Foolish questions, vain questions, questions one never asked\n",
      "if one was occupied. Is human life this? Is human life that? One\n",
      "never had time to think about it. But here he was asking himself that\n",
      "sort of question, because Mrs. Ramsay was giving orders to servants, and\n",
      "also because it had struck him, thinking how surprised Mrs. Ramsay was\n",
      "that Carrie Manning should still exist, that friendships, even the best\n",
      "of them, are frail things. One drifts apart. He reproached himself\n",
      "again. He was sitting beside Mrs. Ramsay and he had nothing in the\n",
      "world to say to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so sorry,\" said Mrs. Ramsy, turning to him at last. He felt rigid\n",
      "and barren, like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so\n",
      "that you can hardly force your feet into them. Yet he must force his\n",
      "feet into them. He must make himself talk. Unless he were very\n",
      "careful, she would find out this treachery of his; that he did not care\n",
      "a straw for her, and that would not be at all pleasant, he thought. So\n",
      "he bent his head courteously in her direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How you must detest dining in this bear garden,\" she said, making use,\n",
      "as she did when she was distracted, of her social manner. So, when\n",
      "there is a strife of tongues, at some meeting, the chairman, to obtain\n",
      "unity, suggests that every one shall speak in French. Perhaps it is\n",
      "bad French; French may not contain the words that express the speaker's\n",
      "thoughts; nevertheless speaking French imposes some order, some\n",
      "uniformity. Replying to her in the same language, Mr. Bankes said, \"No,\n",
      "not at all,\" and Mr. Tansley, who had no knowledge of this language,\n",
      "even spoke thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its\n",
      "insincerity. They did talk nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he\n",
      "pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of\n",
      "these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends. There, in a\n",
      "society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically\n",
      "describe \"staying with the Ramsays\" and what nonsense they talked. It\n",
      "was worth while doing it once, he would say; but not again. The women\n",
      "bored one so, he would say. Of course Ramsay had dished himself by\n",
      "marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children. It would shape\n",
      "itself something like that, but now, at this moment, sitting stuck\n",
      "there with an empty seat beside him, nothing had shaped itself at all.\n",
      "It was all in scraps and fragments. He felt extremely, even\n",
      "physically, uncomfortable. He wanted somebody to give him a chance of\n",
      "asserting himself. He wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his\n",
      "chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to break into\n",
      "their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again. They were talking\n",
      "about the fishing industry. Why did no one ask him his opinion? What\n",
      "did they know about the fishing industry?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily Briscoe knew all that. Sitting opposite him, could she not see,\n",
      "as in an X-ray photograph, the ribs and thigh bones of the young man's\n",
      "desire to impress himself, lying dark in the mist of his flesh--that\n",
      "thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break\n",
      "into the conversation? But, she thought, screwing up her Chinese\n",
      "eyes, and remembering how he sneered at women, \"can't paint, can't\n",
      "write,\" why should I help him to relieve himself?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a code of behaviour, she knew, whose seventh article (it may\n",
      "be) says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman, whatever\n",
      "her own occupation might be, to go to the help of the young man\n",
      "opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones, the ribs,\n",
      "of his vanity, of his urgent desire to assert himself; as indeed it is\n",
      "their duty, she reflected, in her old maidenly fairness, to help us,\n",
      "suppose the Tube were to burst into flames. Then, she thought, I should\n",
      "certainly expect Mr. Tansley to get me out. But how would it be, she\n",
      "thought, if neither of us did either of these things? So she sat there\n",
      "smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not planning to go to the Lighthouse, are you, Lily,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay. \"Remember poor Mr. Langley; he had been round the world dozens\n",
      "of times, but he told me he never suffered as he did when my husband\n",

      "descended, that he could not smite that butterfly with such an\n",
      "instrument as this, said only that he had never been sick in his life.\n",
      "But in that one sentence lay compact, like gunpowder, that his\n",
      "grandfather was a fisherman; his father a chemist; that he had worked\n",
      "his way up entirely himself; that he was proud of it; that he was\n",
      "Charles Tansley--a fact that nobody there seemed to realise; but one of\n",
      "these days every single person would know it. He scowled ahead of him.\n",
      "He could almost pity these mild cultivated people, who would be blown\n",

      "Another touch and they will snap\"--when Mrs. Ramsay said all this, as\n",

      "thrown out of a boat when he was a baby; how his father used to fish\n",
      "him out with a boat-hook; that was how he had learnt to swim. One of\n",
      "his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the Scottish coast,\n",
      "he said. He had been there with him in a storm. This was said loudly\n",
      "in a pause. They had to listen to him when he said that he had been\n",
      "with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm. Ah, thought Lily Briscoe,\n",

      "he liked her, and as he was beginning to enjoy himself, so now, Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay thought, she could return to that dream land, that unreal but\n",
      "fascinating place, the Mannings' drawing-room at Marlow twenty years\n",
      "ago; where one moved about without haste or anxiety, for there was no\n",
      "future to worry about. She knew what had happened to them, what to\n",
      "her. It was like reading a good book again, for she knew the end of\n",
      "that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which\n",
      "shot down even from this dining-room table in cascades, heaven knows\n",
      "where, was sealed up there, and lay, like a lake, placidly between its\n",

      "Mr. Bankes felt that something was lacking. Pulling her shawl round her\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay felt that something was lacking. All of them bending\n",
      "themselves to listen thought, \"Pray heaven that the inside of my mind\n",
      "may not be exposed,\" for each thought, \"The others are feeling this.\n",
      "They are outraged and indignant with the government about the\n",
      "fishermen. Whereas, I feel nothing at all.\" But perhaps, thought Mr.\n",
      "Bankes, as he looked at Mr. Tansley, here is the man. One was always\n",
      "waiting for the man. There was always a chance. At any moment the\n",
      "leader might arise; the man of genius, in politics as in anything else.\n",
      "Probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies, thought Mr.\n",
      "Bankes, doing his best to make allowances, for he knew by some curious\n",
      "physical sensation, as of nerves erect in his spine, that he was\n",
      "jealous, for himself partly, partly more probably for his work, for his\n",
      "point of view, for his science; and therefore he was not entirely open-\n",
      "minded or altogether fair, for Mr. Tansley seemed to be saying, You have\n",
      "wasted your lives. You are all of you wrong. Poor old fogies, you're\n",
      "hopelessly behind the times. He seemed to be rather cocksure, this\n",
      "young man; and his manners were bad. But Mr. Bankes bade himself\n",
      "observe, he had courage; he had ability; he was extremely well up in\n",
      "the facts. Probably, Mr. Bankes thought, as Tansley abused the\n",
      "government, there is a good deal in what he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me now...\" he said. So they argued about politics, and Lily\n",
      "looked at the leaf on the table-cloth; and Mrs. Ramsay, leaving the\n",
      "argument entirely in the hands of the two men, wondered why she was so\n",
      "bored by this talk, and wished, looking at her husband at the other end\n",
      "of the table, that he would say something. One word, she said to\n",
      "herself. For if he said a thing, it would make all the difference. He\n",
      "went to the heart of things. He cared about fishermen and their wages.\n",
      "He could not sleep for thinking of them. It was altogether different\n",
      "when he spoke; one did not feel then, pray heaven you don't see how\n",
      "little I care, because one did care. Then, realising that it was because\n",
      "she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak, she\n",
      "felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their\n",
      "marriage, and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was\n",
      "she herself who had praised him. She looked at him thinking to find\n",
      "this in his face; he would be looking magnificent... But not in the\n",
      "least! He was screwing his face up, he was scowling and frowning, and\n",
      "flushing with anger. What on earth was it about? she wondered. What\n",
      "could be the matter? Only that poor old Augustus had asked for\n",
      "another plate of soup--that was all. It was unthinkable, it was\n",
      "detestable (so he signalled to her across the table) that Augustus\n",
      "should be beginning his soup over again. He loathed people eating when\n",
      "he had finished. She saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his\n",
      "eyes, his brow, and she knew that in a moment something violent would\n",
      "explode, and then--thank goodness! she saw him clutch himself and clap\n",
      "a brake on the wheel, and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks\n",
      "but not words. He sat there scowling. He had said nothing, he would\n",
      "have her observe. Let her give him the credit for that! But why\n",
      "after all should poor Augustus not ask for another plate of soup? He\n",
      "had merely touched Ellen's arm and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ellen, please, another plate of soup,\" and then Mr. Ramsay scowled like\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And why not? Mrs. Ramsay demanded. Surely they could let Augustus have\n",
      "his soup if he wanted it. He hated people wallowing in food, Mr. Ramsay\n",
      "frowned at her. He hated everything dragging on for hours like this.\n",
      "But he had controlled himself, Mr. Ramsay would have her observe,\n",
      "disgusting though the sight was. But why show it so plainly, Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay demanded (they looked at each other down the long table sending\n",
      "these questions and answers across, each knowing exactly what the other\n",
      "felt). Everybody could see, Mrs. Ramsay thought. There was Rose gazing\n",
      "at her father, there was Roger gazing at his father; both would be off\n",
      "in spasms of laughter in another second, she knew, and so she said\n",
      "promptly (indeed it was time):\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Light the candles,\" and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled\n",
      "at the sideboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why could he never conceal his feelings? Mrs. Ramsay wondered, and she\n",
      "wondered if Augustus Carmichael had noticed. Perhaps he had; perhaps\n",
      "he had not. She could not help respecting the composure with which he\n",
      "sat there, drinking his soup. If he wanted soup, he asked for soup.\n",
      "Whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same.\n",
      "He did not like her, she knew that; but partly for that very reason she\n",
      "respected him, and looking at him, drinking soup, very large and calm\n",
      "in the failing light, and monumental, and contemplative, she wondered\n",
      "what he did feel then, and why he was always content and dignified; and\n",
      "she thought how devoted he was to Andrew, and would call him into his\n",
      "room, and Andrew said, \"show him things.\" And there he would lie all\n",
      "day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry, till he\n",
      "reminded one of a cat watching birds, and then he clapped his paws\n",
      "together when he had found the word, and her husband said, \"Poor old\n",
      "Augustus--he's a true poet,\" which was high praise from her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now eight candles were stood down the table, and after the first stoop\n",
      "the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long\n",
      "table entire, and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit. What\n",
      "had she done with it, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, for Rose's arrangement of\n",
      "the grapes and pears, of the horny pink-lined shell, of the bananas,\n",
      "made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea, of\n",
      "Neptune's banquet, of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the\n",
      "shoulder of Bacchus (in some picture), among the leopard skins and the\n",
      "torches lolloping red and gold... Thus brought up suddenly into the\n",
      "light it seemed possessed of great size and depth, was like a world in\n",
      "which one could take one's staff and climb hills, she thought, and go\n",
      "down into valleys, and to her pleasure (for it brought them into\n",
      "sympathy momentarily) she saw that Augustus too feasted his eyes on the\n",
      "same plate of fruit, plunged in, broke off a bloom there, a tassel\n",
      "here, and returned, after feasting, to his hive. That was his way of\n",
      "looking, different from hers. But looking together united them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of the\n",
      "table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as they\n",
      "had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for the night\n",
      "was now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate\n",
      "view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside\n",
      "the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection\n",
      "in which things waved and vanished, waterily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some change at once went through them all, as if this had really\n",
      "happened, and they were all conscious of making a party together in a\n",
      "hollow, on an island; had their common cause against that fluidity out\n",
      "there. Mrs. Ramsay, who had been uneasy, waiting for Paul and Minta to\n",
      "come in, and unable, she felt, to settle to things, now felt her\n",
      "uneasiness changed to expectation. For now they must come, and Lily\n",
      "Briscoe, trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration,\n",
      "compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly\n",
      "vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same\n",
      "effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and\n",
      "the uncurtained windows, and the bright mask-like look of faces seen by\n",
      "candlelight. Some weight was taken off them; anything might happen,\n",
      "she felt. They must come now, Mrs. Ramsay thought, looking at the door,\n",
      "and at that instant, Minta Doyle, Paul Rayley, and a maid carrying a\n",
      "great dish in her hands came in together. They were awfully late; they\n",
      "were horribly late, Minta said, as they found their way to different\n",
      "ends of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I lost my brooch--my grandmother's brooch,\" said Minta with a sound of\n",
      "lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large brown eyes,\n",
      "looking down, looking up, as she sat by Mr. Ramsay, which roused his\n",
      "chivalry so that he bantered her.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could she be such a goose, he asked, as to scramble about the rocks\n",
      "in jewels?\n",
      "\n",
      "She was by way of being terrified of him--he was so fearfully clever,\n",
      "and the first night when she had sat by him, and he talked about George\n",
      "Eliot, she had been really frightened, for she had left the third\n",
      "volume of MIDDLEMARCH in the train and she never knew what happened in\n",
      "the end; but afterwards she got on perfectly, and made herself out even\n",
      "more ignorant than she was, because he liked telling her she was a\n",
      "fool. And so tonight, directly he laughed at her, she was not\n",
      "frightened. Besides, she knew, directly she came into the room that the\n",
      "miracle had happened; she wore her golden haze. Sometimes she had it;\n",
      "sometimes not. She never knew why it came or why it went, or if she\n",
      "had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the\n",
      "way some man looked at her. Yes, tonight she had it, tremendously; she\n",
      "knew that by the way Mr. Ramsay told her not to be a fool. She sat\n",
      "beside him, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must have happened then, thought Mrs. Ramsay; they are engaged. And\n",
      "for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again--\n",
      "jealousy. For he, her husband, felt it too--Minta's glow; he liked\n",
      "these girls, these golden-reddish girls, with something flying,\n",
      "something a little wild and harum-scarum about them, who didn't\n",
      "\"scrape their hair off,\" weren't, as he said about poor Lily Briscoe,\n",
      "\"skimpy\". There was some quality which she herself had not, some\n",
      "lustre, some richness, which attracted him, amused him, led him to make\n",
      "favourites of girls like Minta. They might cut his hair from him,\n",
      "plait him watch-chains, or interrupt him at his work, hailing him (she\n",
      "heard them), \"Come along, Mr. Ramsay; it's our turn to beat them now,\"\n",
      "and out he came to play tennis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But indeed she was not jealous, only, now and then, when she made\n",
      "herself look in her glass, a little resentful that she had grown old,\n",
      "perhaps, by her own fault. (The bill for the greenhouse and all the\n",
      "rest of it.) She was grateful to them for laughing at him. (\"How many\n",
      "pipes have you smoked today, Mr. Ramsay?\" and so on), till he seemed a\n",
      "young man; a man very attractive to women, not burdened, not weighed\n",
      "down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and\n",
      "his fame or his failure, but again as she had first known him, gaunt\n",
      "but gallant; helping her out of a boat, she remembered; with delightful\n",
      "ways, like that (she looked at him, and he looked astonishingly young,\n",
      "teasing Minta). For herself--\"Put it down there,\" she said, helping\n",
      "the Swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which\n",
      "was the BOEUF EN DAUBE--for her own part, she liked her boobies. Paul\n",
      "must sit by her. She had kept a place for him. Really, she sometimes\n",
      "thought she liked the boobies best. They did not bother one with their\n",
      "dissertations. How much they missed, after all, these very clever men!\n",
      "How dried up they did become, to be sure. There was something, she\n",
      "thought as he sat down, very charming about Paul. His manners were\n",
      "delightful to her, and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes. He\n",
      "was so considerate. Would he tell her--now that they were all talking\n",
      "again--what had happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We went back to look for Minta's brooch,\" he said, sitting down by\n",
      "her. \"We\"--that was enough. She knew from the effort, the rise in his\n",
      "voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had\n",
      "said \"we.\" \"We did this, we did that.\" They'll say that all their\n",
      "lives, she thought, and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice\n",
      "rose from the great brown dish as Marthe, with a little flourish, took\n",
      "the cover off. The cook had spent three days over that dish. And she\n",
      "must take great care, Mrs. Ramsay thought, diving into the soft mass, to\n",
      "choose a specially tender piece for William Bankes. And she peered into\n",
      "the dish, with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and\n",
      "yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine, and thought, This will\n",
      "celebrate the occasion--a curious sense rising in her, at once freakish\n",
      "and tender, of celebrating a festival, as if two emotions were called\n",
      "up in her, one profound--for what could be more serious than the love\n",
      "of man for woman, what more commanding, more impressive, bearing in its\n",
      "bosom the seeds of death; at the same time these lovers, these people\n",
      "entering into illusion glittering eyed, must be danced round with\n",
      "mockery, decorated with garlands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a triumph,\" said Mr. Bankes, laying his knife down for a moment.\n",
      "He had eaten attentively. It was rich; it was tender. It was perfectly\n",
      "cooked. How did she manage these things in the depths of the country?\n",
      "he asked her. She was a wonderful woman. All his love, all his\n",
      "reverence, had returned; and she knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a French recipe of my grandmother's,\" said Mrs. Ramsay, speaking\n",
      "with a ring of great pleasure in her voice. Of course it was French.\n",
      "What passes for cookery in England is an abomination (they agreed). It\n",
      "is putting cabbages in water. It is roasting meat till it is like\n",
      "leather. It is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables. \"In\n",
      "which,\" said Mr. Bankes, \"all the virtue of the vegetable is contained.\"\n",
      "And the waste, said Mrs. Ramsay. A whole French family could live on\n",
      "what an English cook throws away. Spurred on by her sense that\n",
      "William's affection had come back to her, and that everything was all\n",
      "right again, and that her suspense was over, and that now she was free\n",
      "both to triumph and to mock, she laughed, she gesticulated, till Lily\n",
      "thought, How childlike, how absurd she was, sitting up there with all\n",
      "her beauty opened again in her, talking about the skins of vegetables.\n",
      "There was something frightening about her. She was irresistible.\n",
      "Always she got her own way in the end, Lily thought. Now she had\n",
      "brought this off--Paul and Minta, one might suppose, were engaged. Mr.\n",
      "Bankes was dining here. She put a spell on them all, by wishing, so\n",
      "simply, so directly, and Lily contrasted that abundance with her own\n",
      "poverty of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her\n",
      "face was all lit up--without looking young, she looked radiant) in this\n",
      "strange, this terrifying thing, which made Paul Rayley, sitting at her\n",
      "side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed, silent. Mrs. Ramsay,\n",
      "Lily felt, as she talked about the skins of vegetables, exalted that,\n",
      "worshipped that; held her hands over it to warm them, to protect it,\n",
      "and yet, having brought it all about, somehow laughed, led her victims,\n",
      "Lily felt, to the altar. It came over her too now--the emotion, the\n",
      "vibration, of love. How inconspicuous she felt herself by Paul's side!\n",
      "He, glowing, burning; she, aloof, satirical; he, bound for adventure;\n",
      "she, moored to the shore; he, launched, incautious; she solitary,\n",
      "left out--and, ready to implore a share, if it were a disaster, in\n",
      "his disaster, she said shyly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did Minta lose her brooch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled the most exquisite smile, veiled by memory, tinged by dreams.\n",
      "He shook his head. \"On the beach,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to find it,\" he said, \"I'm getting up early.\" This being\n",
      "kept secret from Minta, he lowered his voice, and turned his eyes to\n",
      "where she sat, laughing, beside Mr. Ramsay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help\n",
      "him, envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to\n",
      "pounce on the brooch half-hidden by some stone, and thus herself be\n",
      "included among the sailors and adventurers. But what did he reply to\n",
      "her offer? She actually said with an emotion that she seldom let\n",
      "appear, \"Let me come with you,\" and he laughed. He meant yes or no--\n",
      "either perhaps. But it was not his meaning--it was the odd chuckle\n",
      "he gave, as if he had said, Throw yourself over the cliff if you like,\n",
      "I don't care. He turned on her cheek the heat of love, its horror, its\n",
      "cruelty, its unscrupulosity. It scorched her, and Lily, looking at\n",
      "Minta, being charming to Mr. Ramsay at the other end of the table,\n",
      "flinched for her exposed to these fangs, and was thankful. For at any\n",
      "rate, she said to herself, catching sight of the salt cellar on the\n",
      "pattern, she need not marry, thank Heaven: she need not undergo that\n",
      "degradation. She was saved from that dilution. She would move the tree\n",
      "rather more to the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the complexity of things. For what happened to her,\n",
      "especially staying with the Ramsays, was to be made to feel violently\n",
      "two opposite things at the same time; that's what you feel, was one;\n",
      "that's what I feel, was the other, and then they fought together in her\n",
      "mind, as now. It is so beautiful, so exciting, this love, that I\n",
      "tremble on the verge of it, and offer, quite out of my own habit, to\n",
      "look for a brooch on a beach; also it is the stupidest, the most\n",
      "barbaric of human passions, and turns a nice young man with a profile\n",
      "like a gem's (Paul's was exquisite) into a bully with a crowbar (he\n",
      "was swaggering, he was insolent) in the Mile End Road. Yet, she said to\n",
      "herself, from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love; wreaths\n",
      "heaped and roses; and if you asked nine people out of ten they would\n",
      "say they wanted nothing but this--love; while the women, judging from\n",
      "her own experience, would all the time be feeling, This is not what we\n",
      "want; there is nothing more tedious, puerile, and inhumane than this;\n",
      "yet it is also beautiful and necessary. Well then, well then? she\n",
      "asked, somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument, as if\n",
      "in an argument like this one threw one's own little bolt which fell\n",
      "short obviously and left the others to carry it on. So she listened\n",
      "again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon\n",
      "the question of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" said Mr. Bankes, \"there is that liquid the English call coffee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, coffee!\" said Mrs. Ramsay. But it was much rather a question (she\n",
      "was thoroughly roused, Lily could see, and talked very emphatically) of\n",
      "real butter and clean milk. Speaking with warmth and eloquence, she\n",
      "described the iniquity of the English dairy system, and in what state\n",
      "milk was delivered at the door, and was about to prove her charges, for\n",
      "she had gone into the matter, when all round the table, beginning with\n",
      "Andrew in the middle, like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze,\n",
      "her children laughed; her husband laughed; she was laughed at, fire-\n",
      "encircled, and forced to veil her crest, dismount her batteries, and\n",
      "only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table\n",
      "to Mr. Bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the\n",
      "prejudices of the British Public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that Lily, who had\n",
      "helped her with Mr. Tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from\n",
      "the rest; said \"Lily anyhow agrees with me,\" and so drew her in, a\n",
      "little fluttered, a little startled. (For she was thinking about\n",
      "love.) They were both out of things, Mrs. Ramsay had been thinking,\n",
      "both Lily and Charles Tansley. Both suffered from the glow of the\n",
      "other two. He, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no\n",
      "woman would look at him with Paul Rayley in the room. Poor fellow!\n",
      "Still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon\n",
      "something: he could take care of himself. With Lily it was different.\n",
      "She faded, under Minta's glow; became more inconspicuous than ever, in\n",
      "her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little\n",
      "Chinese eyes. Everything about her was so small. Yet, thought Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay, comparing her with Minta, as she claimed her help (for Lily\n",
      "should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her\n",
      "husband did about his boots--he would talk by the hour about his boots)\n",
      "of the two, Lily at forty will be the better. There was in Lily a\n",
      "thread of something; a flare of something; something of her own which\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay liked very much indeed, but no man would, she feared.\n",
      "Obviously, not, unless it were a much older man, like William Bankes.\n",
      "But then he cared, well, Mrs. Ramsay sometimes thought that he cared,\n",
      "since his wife's death, perhaps for her. He was not \"in love\" of\n",
      "course; it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are\n",
      "so many. Oh, but nonsense, she thought; William must marry Lily. They\n",
      "have so many things in common. Lily is so fond of flowers. They are\n",
      "both cold and aloof and rather self-sufficing. She must arrange for\n",
      "them to take a long walk together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foolishly, she had set them opposite each other. That could be remedied\n",
      "tomorrow. If it were fine, they should go for a picnic. Everything\n",

      "like a hawk suspended; like a flag floated in an element of joy which\n",
      "filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly, not noisily, solemnly\n",
      "rather, for it arose, she thought, looking at them all eating there,\n",
      "from husband and children and friends; all of which rising in this\n",
      "profound stillness (she was helping William Bankes to one very small\n",
      "piece more, and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot) seemed\n",
      "now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke, like a fume\n",
      "rising upwards, holding them safe together. Nothing need be said;\n",
      "nothing could be said. There it was, all round them. It partook, she\n",
      "felt, carefully helping Mr. Bankes to a specially tender piece, of\n",
      "eternity; as she had already felt about something different once before\n",
      "that afternoon; there is a coherence in things, a stability; something,\n",
      "she meant, is immune from change, and shines out (she glanced at the\n",
      "window with its ripple of reflected lights) in the face of the flowing,\n",
      "the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby; so that again tonight she had\n",
      "the feeling she had had once today, already, of peace, of rest. Of\n",
      "such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she assured William Bankes, \"there is plenty for everybody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andrew,\" she said, \"hold your plate lower, or I shall spill it.\" (The\n",

      "helped) listening; could then, like a hawk which lapses suddenly from\n",
      "its high station, flaunt and sink on laughter easily, resting her whole\n",
      "weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying\n",
      "about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty-three.\n",
      "That was the number, it seemed, on his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did it all mean? To this day she had no notion. A square root?\n",
      "What was that? Her sons knew. She leant on them; on cubes and square\n",
      "roots; that was what they were talking about now; on Voltaire and\n",
      "Madame de Stael; on the character of Napoleon; on the French system of\n",
      "land tenure; on Lord Rosebery; on Creevey's Memoirs: she let it uphold\n",

      "intelligence, which ran up and down, crossed this way and that, like\n",
      "iron girders spanning the swaying fabric, upholding the world, so that\n",
      "she could trust herself to it utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker\n",
      "them for a moment, as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the\n",
      "myriad layers of the leaves of a tree. Then she woke up. It was still\n",
      "being fabricated. William Bankes was praising the Waverly novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "He read one of them every six months, he said. And why should that make\n",
      "Charles Tansley angry? He rushed in (all, thought Mrs. Ramsay, because\n",

      "knew nothing about it, nothing about it whatsoever, Mrs. Ramsay thought,\n",
      "observing him rather than listening to what he said. She could see how\n",
      "it was from his manner--he wanted to assert himself, and so it would\n",
      "always be with him till he got his Professorship or married his wife,\n",
      "and so need not be always saying, \"I--I--I.\" For that was what his\n",
      "criticism of poor Sir Walter, or perhaps it was Jane Austen, amounted\n",
      "to. \"I---I---I.\" He was thinking of himself and the impression he\n",
      "was making, as she could tell by the sound of his voice, and his\n",
      "emphasis and his uneasiness. Success would be good for him. At any\n",
      "rate they were off again. Now she need not listen. It could not last,\n",
      "she knew, but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to\n",
      "go round the table unveiling each of these people, and their thoughts\n",
      "and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under water so\n",
      "that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing\n",
      "themselves, and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging,\n",
      "trembling. So she saw them; she heard them; but whatever they said had\n",
      "also this quality, as if what they said was like the movement of a\n",
      "trout when, at the same time, one can see the ripple and the gravel,\n",
      "something to the right, something to the left; and the whole is held\n",
      "together; for whereas in active life she would be netting and\n",
      "separating one thing from another; she would be saying she liked the\n",
      "Waverly novels or had not read them; she would be urging herself\n",
      "forward; now she said nothing. For the moment, she hung suspended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, but how long do you think it'll last?\" said somebody. It was as\n",
      "if she had antennae trembling out from her, which, intercepting certain\n",
      "sentences, forced them upon her attention. This was one of them. She\n",
      "scented danger for her husband. A question like that would lead,\n",
      "almost certainly, to something being said which reminded him of his own\n",
      "failure. How long would he be read--he would think at once. William\n",
      "Bankes (who was entirely free from all such vanity) laughed, and said\n",
      "he attached no importance to changes in fashion. Who could tell what\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Let us enjoy what we do enjoy,\" he said. His integrity seemed to Mrs.\n",

      "does this affect me? But then if you had the other temperament, which\n",
      "must have praise, which must have encouragement, naturally you began\n",
      "(and she knew that Mr. Ramsay was beginning) to be uneasy; to want\n",
      "somebody to say, Oh, but your work will last, Mr. Ramsay, or something\n",
      "like that. He showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying, with\n",
      "some irritation, that, anyhow, Scott (or was it Shakespeare ?) would\n",
      "last him his lifetime. He said it irritably. Everybody, she thought,\n",
      "felt a little uncomfortable, without knowing why. Then Minta Doyle,\n",
      "whose instinct was fine, said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not\n",
      "believe that any one really enjoyed reading Shakespeare. Mr. Ramsay\n",
      "said grimly (but his mind was turned away again) that very few people\n",
      "liked it as much as they said they did. But, he added, there is\n",
      "considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at\n",
      "Minta, and she, Mrs. Ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about\n",
      "himself, would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and\n",
      "praise him, somehow or other. But she wished it was not necessary:\n",
      "perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary. Anyhow, she was free\n",
      "now to listen to what Paul Rayley was trying to say about books one had\n",
      "read as a boy. They lasted, he said. He had read some of Tolstoi at\n",
      "school. There was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the\n",
      "name. Russian names were impossible, said Mrs. Ramsay. \"Vronsky,\" said\n",
      "Paul. He remembered that because he always thought it such a good name\n",
      "for a villain. \"Vronsky,\" said Mrs. Ramsay; \"Oh, ANNA KARENINA,\" but\n",
      "that did not take them very far; books were not in their line. No,\n",
      "Charles Tansley would put them both right in a second about books, but\n",
      "it was all so mixed up with, Am I saying the right thing? Am I making\n",
      "a good impression? that, after all, one knew more about him than\n",
      "about Tolstoi, whereas, what Paul said was about the thing, simply, not\n",
      "himself, nothing else. Like all stupid people, he had a kind of\n",
      "modesty too, a consideration for what you were feeling, which, once in\n",
      "a way at least, she found attractive. Now he was thinking, not about\n",
      "himself, or about Tolstoi, but whether she was cold, whether she felt a\n",
      "draught, whether she would like a pear.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, she said, she did not want a pear. Indeed she had been keeping\n",
      "guard over the dish of fruit (without realising it) jealously, hoping\n",
      "that nobody would touch it. Her eyes had been going in and out among\n",
      "the curves and shadows of the fruit, among the rich purples of the\n",
      "lowland grapes, then over the horny ridge of the shell, putting a\n",
      "yellow against a purple, a curved shape against a round shape, without\n",
      "knowing why she did it, or why, every time she did it, she felt more\n",
      "and more serene; until, oh, what a pity that they should do it--a hand\n",
      "reached out, took a pear, and spoilt the whole thing. In sympathy she\n",
      "looked at Rose. She looked at Rose sitting between Jasper and Prue.\n",
      "How odd that one's child should do that!\n",
      "\n",
      "How odd to see them sitting there, in a row, her children, Jasper,\n",
      "Rose, Prue, Andrew, almost silent, but with some joke of their own\n",
      "going on, she guessed, from the twitching at their lips. It was\n",
      "something quite apart from everything else, something they were\n",
      "hoarding up to laugh over in their own room. It was not about their\n",
      "father, she hoped. No, she thought not. What was it, she wondered,\n",
      "sadly rather, for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was\n",
      "not there. There was all that hoarded behind those rather set, still,\n",
      "mask-like faces, for they did not join in easily; they were like\n",
      "watchers, surveyors, a little raised or set apart  from the grown-up\n",
      "people. But when she looked at Prue tonight, she saw that this was\n",
      "not now quite true of her. She was just beginning, just moving,\n",
      "just descending. The faintest light was on her face, as if the\n",
      "glow of Minta opposite, some excitement, some anticipation of happiness\n",
      "was reflected in her, as if the sun of the love of men and women rose\n",
      "over the rim of the table-cloth, and without knowing what it was she\n",
      "bent towards it and greeted it. She kept looking at Minta, shyly, yet\n",
      "curiously, so that Mrs. Ramsay looked from one to the other and said,\n",
      "speaking to Prue in her own mind, You will be as happy as she is one of\n",
      "these days. You will be much happier, she added, because you are my\n",
      "daughter, she meant; her own daughter must be happier than other\n",
      "people's daughters. But dinner was over. It was time to go. They\n",
      "were only playing with things on their plates. She would wait until\n",
      "they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling. He was\n",
      "having a joke with Minta about a bet. Then she would get up.\n",
      "\n",
      "She liked Charles Tansley, she thought, suddenly; she liked his laugh.\n",
      "She liked him for being so angry with Paul and Minta. She liked his\n",
      "awkwardness. There was a lot in that young man after all. And Lily,\n",
      "she thought, putting her napkin beside her plate, she always has some\n",
      "joke of her own. One need never bother about Lily. She waited. She\n",
      "tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate. Well, were they done\n",
      "now? No. That story had led to another story. Her husband was in\n",
      "great spirits tonight, and wishing, she supposed, to make it all right\n",
      "with old Augustus after that scene about the soup, had drawn him in--\n",
      "they were telling stories about some one they had both known at\n",
      "college. She looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt\n",
      "brighter now that the panes were black, and looking at that outside\n",
      "the voices came to her very strangely, as if they were voices at a\n",
      "service in a cathedral, for she did not listen to the words. The\n",
      "sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice (Minta's) speaking\n",
      "alone, reminded her of men and boys crying out the Latin words\n",
      "of a service in some Roman Catholic cathedral. She waited. Her\n",
      "husband spoke. He was repeating something, and she knew it was poetry\n",
      "from the rhythm and the ring of exultation, and melancholy in his\n",
      "voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "Come out and climb the garden path, Luriana Lurilee.\n",
      "The China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The words (she was looking at the window) sounded as if they were\n",
      "floating like flowers on water out there, cut off from them all, as if\n",
      "no one had said them, but they had come into existence of themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be\n",
      "Are full of trees and changing leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not know what they meant, but, like music, the words seemed to\n",
      "be spoken by her own voice, outside her self, saying quite easily and\n",
      "naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said\n",
      "different things. She knew, without looking round, that every one at\n",
      "the table was listening to the voice saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if it seems to you, Luriana, Lurilee\n",
      "\n",
      "with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had, as if this\n",
      "were, at last, the natural thing to say, this were their own voice\n",
      "speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the voice had stopped. She looked round. She made herself get up.\n",
      "Augustus Carmichael had risen and, holding his table napkin so that it\n",
      "looked like a long white robe he stood chanting:\n",
      "\n",
      "To see the Kings go riding by\n",
      "Over lawn and daisy lea\n",
      "With their palm leaves and cedar\n",
      "Luriana, Lurilee,\n",
      "\n",

      "last words:\n",
      "\n",
      "Luriana, Lurilee\n",
      "\n",
      "and bowed to her as if he did her homage. Without knowing why, she\n",
      "felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before; and with a\n",
      "feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and passed through\n",
      "the door which he held open for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was necessary now to carry everything a step further. With her foot\n",
      "on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was\n",
      "vanishing even as she looked, and then, as she moved and took Minta's\n",
      "arm and left the room, it changed, it shaped itself differently; it had\n",
      "become, she knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder, already\n",
      "the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, Lily thought. There was always something that had to be done\n",
      "at that precise moment, something that Mrs. Ramsay had decided for\n",
      "reasons of her own to do instantly, it might be with every one standing\n",
      "about making jokes, as now, not being able to decide whether they were\n",
      "going into the smoking-room, into the drawing-room, up to the attics.\n",
      "Then one saw Mrs. Ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with\n",
      "Minta's arm in hers, bethink her, \"Yes, it is time for that now,\" and\n",
      "so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone. And\n",
      "directly she went a sort of disintegration set in; they wavered about,\n",
      "went different ways, Mr. Bankes took Charles Tansley by the arm and went\n",
      "off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner\n",
      "about politics, thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening,\n",
      "making the weight fall in a different direction, as if, Lily thought,\n",
      "seeing them go, and hearing a word or two about the policy of the\n",
      "Labour Party, they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were\n",
      "taking their bearings; the change from poetry to politics struck her\n",
      "like that; so Mr. Bankes and Charles Mrs. Ramsay going upstairs in the\n",
      "lamplight alone. Where, Lily wondered, was she going so quickly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that she did in fact run or hurry; she went indeed rather slowly.\n",
      "She felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all\n",
      "that chatter, and pick out one particular thing; the thing that\n",
      "mattered; to detach it; separate it off; clean it of all the emotions\n",
      "and odds and ends of things, and so hold it before her, and bring it to\n",
      "the tribunal where, ranged about in conclave, sat the judges she had\n",
      "set up to decide these things. Is it good, is it bad, is it right or\n",
      "wrong? Where are we all going to? and so on. So she righted\n",
      "herself after the shock of the event, and quite unconsciously and\n",
      "incongruously, used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her\n",
      "to stabilise her position. Her world was changing: they were still.\n",
      "The event had given her a sense of movement. All must be in order.\n",
      "She must get that right and that right, she thought, insensibly\n",
      "approving of the dignity of the trees' stillness, and now again of the\n",
      "superb upward rise (like the beak of a ship up a wave) of the elm\n",
      "branches as the wind raised them. For it was windy (she stood a moment\n",
      "to look out). It was windy, so that the leaves now and then brushed\n",
      "open a star, and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting\n",
      "light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves. Yes,\n",
      "that was done then, accomplished; and as with all things done, became\n",
      "solemn. Now one thought of it, cleared of chatter and emotion, it\n",
      "seemed always to have been, only was shown now and so being shown,\n",
      "struck everything into stability. They would, she thought, going on\n",
      "again, however long they lived, come back to this night; this moon;\n",
      "this wind; this house: and to her too. It flattered her, where she was\n",
      "most susceptible of flattery, to think how, wound about in their\n",
      "hearts, however long they lived she would be woven; and this, and this,\n",
      "and this, she thought, going upstairs, laughing, but affectionately, at\n",
      "the sofa on the landing (her mother's); at the rocking-chair (her\n",
      "father's); at the map of the Hebrides. All that would be revived again\n",
      "in the lives of Paul and Minta; \"the Rayleys\"--she tried the new name\n",
      "over; and she felt, with her hand on the nursery door, that community\n",
      "of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of\n",
      "partition had become so thin that practically (the feeling was one of\n",
      "relief and happiness) it was all one stream, and chairs, tables, maps,\n",
      "were hers, were theirs, it did not matter whose, and Paul and Minta\n",
      "would carry it on when she was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned the handle, firmly, lest it should squeak, and went in,\n",

      "speak aloud. But directly she came in she saw, with annoyance, that the\n",
      "precaution was not needed. The children were not asleep. It was most\n",
      "annoying. Mildred should be more careful. There was James wide awake\n",
      "and Cam sitting bolt upright, and Mildred out of bed in her bare feet,\n",
      "and it was almost eleven and they were all talking. What was the\n",
      "matter? It was that horrid skull again. She had told Mildred to move\n",
      "it, but Mildred, of course, had forgotten, and now there was Cam wide\n",
      "awake, and James wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been\n",
      "asleep hours ago. What had possessed Edward to send them this horrid\n",
      "skull? She had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there. It\n",
      "was nailed fast, Mildred said, and Cam couldn't go to sleep with it in\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Cam must go to sleep (it had great horns said Cam)--must go to\n",
      "sleep and dream of lovely palaces, said Mrs. Ramsay, sitting down\n",
      "on the bed by her side. She could see the horns, Cam said, all over\n",
      "the room. It was true. Wherever they put the light (and James could\n",
      "not sleep without a light) there was always a shadow somewhere.\n",

      "round and round, and then she came back to Cam and laid her head almost\n",

      "something seemed, nevertheless, to go from him to her. It was the\n",

      "that made him slap his thighs. Don't interrupt me, he seemed to be\n",
      "saying, don't say anything; just sit there. And he went on reading.\n",

      "slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step,\n",
      "the wall. It was all Mrs. Ramsay's doing. She was dead. Here was Lily,\n",
      "at forty-four, wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there,\n",
      "playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at, and\n",
      "it was all Mrs. Ramsay's fault. She was dead. The step where she used\n",
      "to sit was empty. She was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why repeat this over and over again? Why be always trying to bring\n",
      "up some feeling she had not got? There was a kind of blasphemy in it.\n",
      "It was all dry: all withered: all spent. They ought not to have asked\n",
      "her; she ought not to have come. One can't waste one's time at forty-\n",
      "four, she thought. She hated playing at painting. A brush, the one\n",
      "dependable thing in a world of strife, ruin, chaos--that one should not\n",
      "play with, knowingly even: she detested it. But he made her. You\n",
      "shan't touch your canvas, he seemed to say, bearing down on her, till\n",
      "you've given me what I want of you. Here he was, close upon her again,\n",
      "greedy, distraught. Well, thought Lily in despair, letting her right\n",
      "hand fall at her side, it would be simpler then to have it over.\n",
      "Surely, she could imitate from recollection the glow, the rhapsody, the\n",
      "self-surrender, she had seen on so many women's faces (on Mrs. Ramsay's,\n",
      "for instance) when on some occasion like this they blazed up--she could\n",
      "remember the look on Mrs. Ramsay's face--into a rapture of sympathy, of\n",
      "delight in the reward they had, which, though the reason of it escaped\n",
      "her, evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human\n",
      "nature was capable. Here he was, stopped by her side. She would give\n",
      "him what she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to have shrivelled slightly, he thought. She looked a little\n",
      "skimpy, wispy; but not unattractive. He liked her. There had been some\n",
      "talk of her marrying William Bankes once, but nothing had come of it.\n",
      "His wife had been fond of her. He had been a little out of temper too\n",
      "at breakfast. And then, and then--this was one of those moments when\n",
      "an enormous need urged him, without being conscious what it was, to\n",
      "approach any woman, to force them, he did not care how, his need was so\n",
      "great, to give him what he wanted: sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was anybody looking after her? he said. Had she everything she\n",
      "wanted?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thanks, everything,\" said Lily Briscoe nervously. No; she could\n",
      "not do it. She ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of\n",
      "sympathetic expansion: the pressure on her was tremendous. But she\n",
      "remained stuck. There was an awful pause. They both looked at the\n",
      "sea. Why, thought Mr. Ramsay, should she look at the sea when I am\n",
      "here? She hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the\n",
      "Lighthouse, she said. The Lighthouse! The Lighthouse! What's that\n",
      "got to do with it? he thought impatiently. Instantly, with the force\n",
      "of some primeval gust (for really he could not restrain himself any\n",
      "longer), there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the\n",
      "whole world would have done something, said something--all except\n",
      "myself, thought Lily, girding at herself bitterly, who am not a woman,\n",
      "but a peevish, ill-tempered, dried-up old maid, presumably.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Mr. Ramsay sighed to the full. He waited. Was she not going to say\n",
      "anything? Did she not see what he wanted from her? Then he said he\n",
      "had a particular reason for wanting to go to the Lighthouse. His\n",
      "wife used to send the men things. There was a poor boy with a\n",
      "tuberculous hip, the lightkeeper's son. He sighed profoundly.\n",
      "He sighed significantly. All Lily wished was that this enormous flood\n",
      "of grief, this insatiable hunger for sympathy, this demand that she\n",
      "should surrender herself up to him entirely, and even so he had sorrows\n",
      "enough to keep her supplied for ever, should leave her, should be\n",
      "diverted (she kept looking at the house, hoping for an interruption)\n",
      "before it swept her down in its flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such expeditions,\" said Mr. Ramsay, scraping the ground with his toe,\n",
      "\"are very painful.\" Still Lily said nothing. (She is a stock, she is a\n",
      "stone, he said to himself.) \"They are very exhausting,\" he said,\n",
      "looking, with a sickly look that nauseated her (he was acting, she\n",
      "felt, this great man was dramatising himself), at his beautiful hands.\n",
      "It was horrible, it was indecent. Would they never come, she asked,\n",
      "for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow, support these\n",
      "heavy draperies of grief (he had assumed a pose of extreme\n",
      "decreptitude; he even tottered a little as he stood there) a moment\n",
      "longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still she could say nothing; the whole horizon seemed swept bare of\n",
      "objects to talk about; could only feel, amazedly, as Mr. Ramsay stood\n",
      "there, how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and\n",
      "discolour it, and cast over the rubicund, drowsy, entirely contented\n",
      "figure of Mr. Carmichael, reading a French novel on a deck-chair, a veil\n",
      "of crape, as if such an existence, flaunting its prosperity in a world\n",
      "of woe, were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all. Look\n",
      "at him, he seemed to be saying, look at me; and indeed, all the time he\n",
      "was feeling, Think of me, think of me. Ah, could that bulk only be\n",
      "wafted alongside of them, Lily wished; had she only pitched her easel a\n",
      "yard or two closer to him; a man, any man, would staunch this effusion,\n",
      "would stop these lamentations. A woman, she had provoked this horror;\n",
      "a woman, she should have known how to deal with it. It was immensely\n",
      "to her discredit, sexually, to stand there dumb. One said--what did\n",
      "one say?--Oh, Mr. Ramsay! Dear Mr. Ramsay! That was what that kind old\n",
      "lady who sketched, Mrs. Beckwith, would have said instantly, and\n",
      "rightly. But, no. They stood there, isolated from the rest of the\n",
      "world. His immense self-pity, his demand for sympathy poured and\n",
      "spread itself in pools at ther feet, and all she did, miserable sinner\n",
      "that she was, was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles,\n",
      "lest she should get wet. In complete silence she stood there, grasping\n",
      "her paint brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven could never be sufficiently praised! She heard sounds in the\n",
      "house. James and Cam must be coming. But Mr. Ramsay, as if he knew\n",
      "that his time ran short, exerted upon her solitary figure the immense\n",
      "pressure of his concentrated woe; his age; his frailty: his desolation;\n",
      "when suddenly, tossing his head impatiently, in his annoyance--for\n",
      "after all, what woman could resist him?--he noticed that his boot-laces\n",
      "were untied. Remarkable boots they were too, Lily thought, looking\n",
      "down at them: sculptured; colossal; like everything that Mr. Ramsay\n",
      "wore, from his frayed tie to his half-buttoned waistcoat, his own\n",
      "indisputably. She could see them walking to his room of their own\n",
      "accord, expressive in his absence of pathos, surliness, ill-temper,\n",
      "charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What beautiful boots!\" she exclaimed. She was ashamed of herself. To\n",
      "praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul; when he had\n",
      "shown her his bleeding hands, his lacerated heart, and asked her to\n",
      "pity them, then to say, cheerfully, \"Ah, but what beautiful boots you\n",
      "wear!\" deserved, she knew, and she looked up expecting to get it in one\n",
      "of his sudden roars of ill-temper complete annihilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Mr. Ramsay smiled. His pall, his draperies, his infirmities\n",
      "fell from him. Ah, yes, he said, holding his foot up for her to look\n",
      "at, they were first-rate boots. There was only one man in England who\n",
      "could make boots like that. Boots are among the chief curses of\n",
      "mankind, he said. \"Bootmakers make it their business,\" he exclaimed,\n",
      "\"to cripple and torture the human foot.\" They are also the most\n",
      "obstinate and perverse of mankind. It had taken him the best part of\n",
      "his youth to get boots made as they should be made. He would have her\n",
      "observe (he lifted his right foot and then his left) that she had never\n",
      "seen boots made quite that shape before. They were made of the finest\n",
      "leather in the world, also. Most leather was mere brown paper and\n",
      "cardboard. He looked complacently at his foot, still held in the air.\n",
      "They had reached, she felt, a sunny island where peace dwelt, sanity\n",
      "reigned and the sun for ever shone, the blessed island of good boots.\n",
      "Her heart warmed to him. \"Now let me see if you can tie a knot,\" he\n",
      "said. He poohpoohed her feeble system. He showed her his own\n",
      "invention. Once you tied it, it never came undone. Three times he\n",
      "knotted her shoe; three times he unknotted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, at this completely inappropriate moment, when he was stooping over\n",
      "her shoe, should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that, as she\n",
      "stooped too, the blood rushed to her face, and, thinking of her\n",
      "callousness (she had called him a play-actor) she felt her eyes swell\n",
      "and tingle with tears? Thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of\n",
      "infinite pathos. He tied knots. He bought boots. There was no helping\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay on the journey he was going. But now just as she wished to\n",
      "say something, could have said something, perhaps, here they were--Cam\n",
      "and James. They appeared on the terrace. They came, lagging, side by\n",
      "side, a serious, melancholy couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why was it like THAT that they came? She could not help feeling\n",
      "annoyed with them; they might have come more cheerfully; they might\n",
      "have given him what, now that they were off, she would not have the\n",
      "chance of giving him. For she felt a sudden emptiness; a frustration.\n",
      "Her feeling had come too late; there it was ready; but he no longer\n",
      "needed it. He had become a very distinguished, elderly man, who had no\n",
      "need of her whatsoever. She felt snubbed. He slung a knapsack round\n",
      "his shoulders. He shared out the parcels--there were a number of them,\n",
      "ill tied in brown paper. He sent Cam for a cloak. He had all the\n",
      "appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition. Then, wheeling\n",
      "about, he led the way with his firm military tread, in those wonderful\n",
      "boots, carrying brown paper parcels, down the path, his children\n",
      "following him. They looked, she thought, as if fate had devoted them\n",
      "to some stern enterprise, and they went to it, still young enough to be\n",
      "drawn acquiescent in their father's wake, obediently, but with a pallor\n",
      "in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond\n",
      "their years in silence. So they passed the edge of the lawn, and it\n",
      "seemed to Lily that she watched a procession go, drawn on by some\n",
      "stress of common feeling which made it, faltering and flagging as it\n",
      "was, a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her.\n",
      "Politely, but very distantly, Mr. Ramsay raised his hand and saluted her\n",
      "as they passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what a face, she thought, immediately finding the sympathy which\n",
      "she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression. What had\n",
      "made it like that? Thinking, night after night, she supposed--about\n",
      "the reality of kitchen tables, she added, remembering the symbol which\n",
      "in her vagueness as to what Mr. Ramsay did think about Andrew had given\n",
      "her. (He had been killed by the splinter of a shell instantly, she\n",
      "bethought her.) The kitchen table was something visionary, austere;\n",
      "something bare, hard, not ornamental. There was no colour to it; it\n",
      "was all edges and angles; it was uncompromisingly plain. But Mr. Ramsay\n",
      "kept always his eyes fixed upon it, never allowed himself to be\n",
      "distracted or deluded, until his face became worn too and ascetic and\n",
      "partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her.\n",
      "Then, she recalled (standing where he had left her, holding her brush),\n",
      "worries had fretted it--not so nobly. He must have had his doubts\n",
      "about that table, she supposed; whether the table was a real table;\n",
      "whether it was worth the time he gave to it; whether he was able after\n",
      "all to find it. He had had doubts, she felt, or he would have asked\n",
      "less of people. That was what they talked about late at night\n",
      "sometimes, she suspected; and then next day Mrs. Ramsay looked tired,\n",
      "and Lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing. But\n",
      "now he had nobody to talk to about that table, or his boots, or his\n",
      "knots; and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, and his\n",
      "face had that touch of desperation, of exaggeration in it which alarmed\n",
      "her, and made her pull her skirts about her. And then, she recalled,\n",
      "there was that sudden revivification, that sudden flare (when she\n",
      "praised his boots), that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in\n",
      "ordinary human things, which too passed and changed (for he was always\n",
      "changing, and hid nothing) into that other final phase which was new to\n",
      "her and had, she owned, made herself ashamed of her own irritability,\n",
      "when it seemed as if he had shed worries and ambitions, and the hope of\n",
      "sympathy and the desire for praise, had entered some other region, was\n",
      "drawn on, as if by curiosity, in dumb colloquy, whether with himself or\n",
      "another, at the head of that little procession out of one's range. An\n",
      "extraordinary face! The gate banged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So they're gone, she thought, sighing with relief and disappointment.\n",
      "Her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her, like a bramble sprung\n",
      "across her face. She felt curiously divided, as if one part of her\n",
      "were drawn out there--it was a still day, hazy; the Lighthouse looked\n",
      "this morning at an immense distance; the other had fixed itself\n",
      "doggedly, solidly, here on the lawn. She saw her canvas as if it had\n",
      "floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before\n",
      "her. It seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry\n",
      "and agitation; this folly and waste of emotion; it drastically recalled\n",
      "her and spread through her mind first a peace, as her disorderly\n",
      "sensations (he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had\n",
      "said nothing) trooped off the field; and then, emptiness. She looked\n",
      "blankly at the canvas, with its uncompromising white stare; from the\n",
      "canvas to the garden. There was something (she stood screwing up her\n",
      "little Chinese eyes in her small puckered face), something she\n",
      "remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across, slicing\n",
      "down, and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and\n",
      "browns, which had stayed in her mind; which had tied a knot in her mind\n",
      "so that at odds and ends of time, involuntarily, as she walked along\n",
      "the Brompton Road, as she brushed her hair, she found herself painting\n",
      "that picture, passing her eye over it, and untying the knot in\n",
      "imagination. But there was all the difference in the world between\n",
      "this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush\n",
      "and making the first mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at Mr. Ramsay's presence,\n",
      "and her easel, rammed into the earth so nervously, was at the wrong\n",
      "angle. And now that she had ut that right, and in so doing had subdued\n",
      "the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made\n",
      "her remember how she was such and such a person, had such and such\n",
      "relations to people, she took her hand and raised her brush. For a\n",
      "moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the\n",
      "air. Where to begin?--that was the question at what point to make\n",
      "the first mark? One line placed on the canvas committed her to\n",
      "innumerable risks, to frequent and irrevocable decisions. All that in\n",
      "idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex; as the waves\n",
      "shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top, but to the swimmer\n",
      "among them are divided by steep gulfs, and foaming crests. Still the\n",
      "risk must be run; the mark made.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a curious physical sensation, as if she were urged forward and at\n",
      "the same time must hold herself back, she made her first quick decisive\n",
      "stroke. The brush descended. It flickered brown over the white canvas;\n",
      "it left a running mark. A second time she did it--a third time. And\n",
      "so pausing and so flickering, she attained a dancing rhythmical\n",
      "movement, as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes\n",
      "another, and all were related; and so, lightly and swiftly pausing,\n",
      "striking, she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which\n",
      "had no sooner settled there than they enclosed ( she felt it looming\n",
      "out at her) a space. Down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next\n",
      "wave towering higher and higher above her. For what could be more\n",
      "formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping\n",
      "back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of\n",
      "community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient\n",
      "enemy of hers--this other thing, this truth, this reality, which\n",
      "suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances\n",
      "and commanded her attention. She was half unwilling, half reluctant.\n",
      "Why always be drawn out and haled away? Why not left in peace, to\n",
      "talk to Mr. Carmichael on the lawn? It was an exacting form of\n",
      "intercourse anyhow. Other worshipful objects were content with\n",
      "worship; men, women, God, all let one kneel prostrate; but this\n",
      "form, were it only the shape of a white lamp-shade looming on a\n",
      "wicker table, roused one to perpetual combat, challenged one to a fight\n",
      "in which one was bound to be worsted. Always (it was in her nature, or\n",
      "in her sex, she did not know which) before she exchanged the fluidity\n",
      "of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of\n",
      "nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body,\n",
      "hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all\n",
      "the blasts of doubt. Why then did she do it? She looked at the\n",
      "canvas, lightly scored with running lines. It would be hung in the\n",
      "servants' bedrooms. It would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa.\n",
      "What was the good of doing it then, and she heard some voice saying she\n",
      "couldn't paint, saying she couldn't create, as if she were caught up in\n",
      "one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience\n",
      "forms in the mind, so that one repeats words without being aware any\n",
      "longer who originally spoke them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't paint, can't write, she murmured monotonously, anxiously\n",
      "considering what her plan of attack should be. For the mass loomed\n",
      "before her; it protruded; she felt it pressing on her eyeballs. Then,\n",
      "as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were\n",
      "spontaneously squirted, she began precariously dipping among the blues\n",
      "and umbers, moving her brush hither and thither, but it was now heavier\n",
      "and went slower, as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was\n",
      "dictated to her (she kept looking at the hedge, at the canvas) by what\n",
      "she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current.\n",
      "Certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things. And as she\n",
      "lost consciousness of outer things, and her name and her personality\n",
      "and her appearance, and whether Mr. Carmichael was there or not, her\n",
      "mind kept throwing up from its depths, scenes, and names, and sayings,\n",
      "and memories and ideas, like a fountain spurting over that glaring,\n",
      "hideously difficult white space, while she modelled it with greens and\n",
      "blues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Tansley used to say that, she remembered, women can't paint,\n",
      "can't write. Coming up behind her, he had stood close beside her, a\n",
      "thing she hated, as she painted her on this very spot. \"Shag tobacco,\"\n",
      "he said, \"fivepence an ounce,\" parading his poverty, his principles.\n",
      "(But the war had drawn the sting of her femininity. Poor devils, one\n",
      "thought, poor devils, of both sexes.) He was always carrying a book\n",

      "the middle of the view. But after all, she reflected, there was the\n",
      "scene on the beach. One must remember that. It was a windy morning.\n",
      "They had all gone down to the beach. Mrs. Ramsay sat down and wrote\n",
      "letters by a rock. She wrote and wrote. \"Oh,\" she said, looking up at\n",

      "she thought of herself and Charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the\n",
      "whole scene on the beach, it seemed to depend somehow upon Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "sitting under the rock, with a pad on her knee, writing letters. (She\n",
      "wrote innumerable letters, and sometimes the wind took them and she and\n",
      "Charles just saved a page from the sea.) But what a power was in the\n",
      "human soul! she thought. That woman sitting there writing under the\n",
      "rock resolved everything into simplicity; made these angers,\n",
      "irritations fall off like old rags; she brought together this and that\n",
      "and then this, and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite\n",
      "(she and Charles squabbling, sparring, had been silly and spiteful)\n",
      "something--this scene on the beach for example, this moment of\n",
      "friendship and liking--which survived, after all these years complete,\n",
      "so that she dipped into it to re-fashion her memory of him, and there\n",
      "it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like a work of art,\" she repeated, looking from her canvas to the\n",
      "drawing-room steps and back again. She must rest for a moment. And,\n",
      "resting, looking from one to the other vaguely, the old question which\n",
      "traversed the sky of the soul perpetually, the vast, the general\n",
      "question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as\n",
      "these, when she released faculties that had been on the strain, stood\n",
      "over her, paused over her, darkened over her. What is the meaning of\n",
      "life? That was all--a simple question; one that tended to close in on\n",
      "one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great\n",
      "revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily\n",
      "miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark;\n",
      "here was one. This, that, and the other; herself and Charles Tansley\n",
      "and the breaking wave; Mrs. Ramsay bringing them together; Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "saying, \"Life stand still here\"; Mrs. Ramsay making of the moment\n",
      "something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to\n",
      "make of the moment something permanent)--this was of the nature\n",
      "of a revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal\n",
      "passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves\n",
      "shaking) was struck into stability. Life stand still here, Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "said. \"Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!\" she repeated. She owed it all to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "All was silence. Nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house. She\n",
      "looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows\n",
      "green and blue with the reflected leaves. The faint thought she was\n",
      "thinking of Mrs. Ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house; this\n",
      "smoke; this fine early morning air. Faint and unreal, it was amazingly\n",
      "pure and exciting. She hoped nobody would open the window or come out\n",
      "of the house, but that she might be left alone to go on thinking, to go\n",
      "on painting. She turned to her canvas. But impelled by some curiosity,\n",
      "driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged,\n",
      "she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether, down\n",
      "there on the beach, she could see that little company setting sail.\n",
      "Down there among the little boats which floated, some with their sails\n",
      "furled, some slowly, for it was very calm moving away, there was one\n",
      "rather apart from the others. The sail was even now being hoisted.\n",
      "She decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little\n",
      "boat Mr. Ramsay was sitting with Cam and James. Now they had got the\n",
      "sail up; now after a little flagging and silence, she watched the boat\n",
      "take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sails flapped over their heads. The water chuckled and slapped the\n",
      "sides of the boat, which drowsed motionless in the sun. Now and then\n",
      "the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but the ripple ran over\n",
      "them and ceased. The boat made no motion at all. Mr. Ramsay sat in the\n",
      "middle of the boat. He would be impatient in a moment, James thought,\n",
      "and Cam thought, looking at her father, who sat in the middle of the\n",
      "boat between them (James steered; Cam sat alone in the bow) with his\n",
      "legs tightly curled. He hated hanging about. Sure enough, after\n",
      "fidgeting a second or two, he said something sharp to Macalister's boy,\n",
      "who got out his oars and began to row. But their father, they knew,\n",
      "would never be content until they were flying along. He would keep\n",
      "looking for a breeze, fidgeting, saying things under his breath, which\n",
      "Macalister and and Macalister's boy would overhear, and they would both\n",
      "be made horribly uncomfortable. He had made them come. He had forced\n",
      "them to come. In their anger they hoped that the breeze would never\n",
      "rise, that he might be thwarted in every possible way, since he had\n",
      "forced them to come against their wills.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together, though\n",
      "he bade them \"Walk up, walk up,\" without speaking. Their heads were\n",
      "bent down, their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale.\n",
      "Speak to him they could not. They must come; they must follow. They\n",
      "must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels. But they vowed, in\n",
      "silence, as they walked, to stand by each other and carry out the great\n",
      "compact--to resist tyranny to the death. So there they would sit, one\n",
      "at one end of the boat, one at the other, in silence. They would say\n",
      "nothing, only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs\n",
      "twisted, frowning and fidgeting, and pishing and pshawing and muttering\n",
      "things to himself, and waiting impatiently for a breeze. And they\n",
      "hoped it would be calm. They hoped he would be thwarted. They hoped\n",
      "the whole expedition would fail, and they would have to put back, with\n",
      "their parcels, to the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, when Macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the sails\n",
      "slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened itself, and\n",
      "shot off. Instantly, as if some great strain had been relieved, Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch, handed it with a\n",
      "little grunt to Macalister, and felt, they knew, for all they suffered,\n",
      "perfectly content. Now they would sail on for hours like this, and Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay would ask old Macalister a question--about the great storm\n",
      "last winter probably--and old Macalister would answer it, and they\n",
      "would puff their pipes together, and Macalister would take a tarry rope\n",
      "in his fingers, tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and\n",
      "never say a word to any one. James would be forced to keep his eye all\n",
      "the time on the sail. For if he forgot, then the sail puckered and\n",
      "shivered, and the boat slackened, and Mr. Ramsay would say sharply,\n",
      "\"Look out! Look out!\" and old Macalister would turn slowly on his\n",
      "seat. So they heard Mr. Ramsay asking some question about the great\n",
      "storm at Christmas. \"She comes driving round the point,\" old\n",
      "Macalister said, describing the great storm last Christmas, when ten\n",
      "ships had been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen \"one\n",
      "there, one there, one there\" (he pointed slowly round the bay. Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay followed him, turning his head). He had seen four men clinging\n",
      "to the mast. Then she was gone. \"And at last we shoved her off,\" he\n",
      "went on (but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word\n",
      "here and there, sitting at opposite ends of the boat, united by their\n",
      "compact to fight tyranny to the death). At last they had shoved\n",
      "her off, they had launched the lifeboat, and they had got her out\n",
      "past the point--Macalister told the story; and though they only\n",
      "caught a word here and there, they were conscious all the time of their\n",
      "father--how he leant forward, how he brought his voice into tune with\n",
      "Macalister's voice; how, puffing at his pipe, and looking there and\n",
      "there where Macalister pointed, he relished the thought of the storm\n",
      "and the dark night and the fishermen striving there. He liked that men\n",
      "should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night; pitting muscle and\n",
      "brain against the waves and the wind; he liked men to work like that,\n",
      "and women to keep house, and sit beside sleeping children indoors,\n",
      "while men were drowned, out there in a storm. So James could tell, so\n",
      "Cam could tell (they looked at him, they looked at each other), from\n",
      "his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice, and the little\n",
      "tinge of Scottish accent which came into his voice, making him seem\n",
      "like a peasant himself, as he questioned Macalister about the eleven\n",
      "ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm. Three had sunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked proudly where Macalister pointed; and Cam thought, feeling\n",
      "proud of him without knowing quite why, had he been there he would have\n",
      "launched the lifeboat, he would have reached the wreck, Cam thought.\n",
      "He was so brave, he was so adventurous, Cam thought. But she\n",
      "remembered. There was the compact; to resist tyranny to the death.\n",
      "Their grievance weighed them down. They had been forced; they had been\n",
      "bidden. He had borne them down once more with his gloom and his\n",
      "authority, making them do his bidding, on this fine morning, come,\n",
      "because he wished it, carrying these parcels, to the Lighthouse; take\n",
      "part in these rites he went through for his own pleasure in memory of\n",
      "dead people, which they hated, so that they lagged after him, all\n",
      "the pleasure of the day was spoilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the breeze was freshening. The boat was leaning, the water was\n",
      "sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades, in bubbles, in\n",
      "cataracts. Cam looked down into the foam, into the sea with all its\n",
      "treasure in it, and its speed hypnotised her, and the tie between her\n",
      "and James sagged a little. It slackened a little. She began to think,\n",
      "How fast it goes. Where are we going? and the movement hypnotised her,\n",
      "while James, with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered\n",
      "grimly. But he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he\n",
      "might be quit of it all. They might land somewhere; and be free then.\n",
      "Both of them, looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape\n",
      "and exaltation, what with the speed and the change. But the breeze\n",
      "bred in Mr. Ramsay too the same excitement, and, as old Macalister\n",
      "turned to fling his line overboard, he cried out aloud,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We perished,\" and then again, \"each alone.\" And then with his usual\n",
      "spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved his hand\n",
      "towards the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See the little house,\" he said pointing, wishing Cam to look. She\n",
      "raised herself reluctantly and looked. But which was it? She could no\n",
      "longer make out, there on the hillside, which was their house. All\n",
      "looked distant and peaceful and strange. The shore seemed refined, far\n",
      "away, unreal. Already the little distance they had sailed had put them\n",
      "far from it and given it the changed look, the composed look, of\n",
      "something receding in which one has no longer any part. Which was\n",
      "their house? She could not see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I beneath a rougher sea,\" Mr. Ramsay murmured. He had found the\n",
      "house and so seeing it, he had also seen himself there; he had seen\n",
      "himself walking on the terrace, alone. He was walking up and down\n",
      "between the urns; and he seemed to himself very old and bowed. Sitting\n",
      "in the boat, he bowed, he crouched himself, acting instantly his part--\n",
      "the part of a desolate man, widowed, bereft; and so called up before\n",
      "him in hosts people sympathising with him; staged for himself as he sat\n",
      "in the boat, a little drama; which required of him decrepitude and\n",
      "exhaustion and sorrow (he raised his hands and looked at the thinness\n",
      "of them, to confirm his dream) and then there was given him in\n",
      "abundance women's sympathy, and he imagined how they would soothe him\n",
      "and sympathise with him, and so getting in his dream some reflection of\n",
      "the exquisite pleasure women's sympathy was to him, he sighed and said\n",
      "gently and mournfully:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I beneath a rougher sea\n",
      "Was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "so that the mournful words were heard quite clearly by them all. Cam\n",
      "half started on her seat. It shocked her--it outraged her. The\n",
      "movement roused her father; and he shuddered, and broke off,\n",
      "exclaiming: \"Look! Look!\" so urgently that James also turned his head\n",
      "to look over his shoulder at the island. They all looked. They looked\n",
      "at the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Cam could see nothing. She was thinking how all those paths and\n",
      "the lawn, thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there, were\n",
      "gone: were rubbed out; were past; were unreal, and now this was real;\n",
      "the boat and the sail with its patch; Macalister with his earrings; the\n",
      "noise of the waves--all this was real. Thinking this, she was\n",
      "murmuring to herself, \"We perished, each alone,\" for her father's words\n",
      "broke and broke again in her mind, when her father, seeing her gazing\n",
      "so vaguely, began to tease her. Didn't she know the points of the\n",
      "compass? he asked. Didn't she know the North from the South? Did she\n",
      "really think they lived right out there? And he pointed again, and\n",
      "showed her where their house was, there, by those trees. He wished she\n",
      "would try to be more accurate, he said: \"Tell me--which is East, which\n",
      "is West?\" he said, half laughing at her, half scolding her, for he\n",
      "could not understand the state of mind of any one, not absolutely\n",
      "imbecile, who did not know the points of the compass. Yet she did not\n",
      "know. And seeing her gazing, with her vague, now rather frightened,\n",
      "eyes fixed where no house was Mr. Ramsay forgot his dream; how he walked\n",
      "up and down between the urns on the terrace; how the arms were\n",
      "stretched out to him. He thought, women are always like that; the\n",
      "vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never been\n",
      "able to understand; but so it was. It had been so with her--his wife.\n",
      "They could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds. But he had\n",
      "been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not rather like this\n",
      "vagueness in women? It was part of their extraordinary charm. I will\n",
      "make her smile at me, he thought. She looks frightened. She was so\n",
      "silent. He clutched his fingers, and determined that his voice and his\n",
      "face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his\n",
      "command making people pity him and praise him all these years should\n",
      "subdue themselves. He would make her smile at him. He would find some\n",
      "simple easy thing to say to her. But what? For, wrapped up in his\n",
      "work as he was, he forgot the sort of thing one said. There was a\n",
      "puppy. They had a puppy. Who was looking after the puppy today? he\n",
      "asked. Yes, thought James pitilessly, seeing his sister's head against\n",
      "the sail, now she will give way. I shall be left to fight the tyrant\n",
      "alone. The compact would be left to him to carry out. Cam would never\n",
      "resist tyranny to the death, he thought grimly, watching her face, sad,\n",
      "sulky, yielding. And as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a\n",
      "green hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding\n",
      "hills is gloom and sorrow, and it seems as if the hills themselves\n",
      "must ponder the fate of the clouded, the darkened, either in pity,\n",
      "or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay: so Cam now felt herself\n",
      "overcast, as she sat there among calm, resolute people and wondered\n",
      "how to answer her father about the puppy; how to resist his\n",
      "entreaty--forgive me, care for me; while James the lawgiver, with the\n",
      "tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee (his hand on the tiller\n",
      "had become symbolical to her), said, Resist him. Fight him. He said\n",
      "so rightly; justly. For they must fight tyranny to the death, she\n",
      "thought. Of all human qualities she reverenced justice most. Her\n",
      "brother was most god-like, her father most suppliant. And to which did\n",
      "she yield, she thought, sitting between them, gazing at the shore whose\n",
      "points were all unknown to her, and thinking how the lawn and the\n",
      "terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jasper,\" she said sullenly. He'd look after the puppy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what was she going to call him? her father persisted. He had had\n",
      "a dog when he was a little boy, called Frisk. She'll give way, James\n",
      "thought, as he watched a look come upon her face, a look he remembered.\n",
      "They look down he thought, at their knitting or something. Then\n",
      "suddenly they look up. There was a flash of blue, he remembered, and\n",
      "then somebody sitting with him laughed, surrendered, and he was very\n",
      "angry. It must have been his mother, he thought, sitting on a low\n",
      "chair, with his father standing over her. He began to search among the\n",
      "infinite series of impressions which time had laid down, leaf upon\n",
      "leaf, fold upon fold softly, incessantly upon his brain; among scents,\n",
      "sounds; voices, harsh, hollow, sweet; and lights passing, and brooms\n",
      "tapping; and the wash and hush of the sea, how a man had marched up and\n",
      "down and stopped dead, upright, over them. Meanwhile, he noticed, Cam\n",
      "dabbled her fingers in the water, and stared at the shore and said\n",
      "nothing. No, she won't give way, he thought; she's different, he\n",
      "thought. Well, if Cam would not answer him, he would not bother her Mr.\n",
      "Ramsay decided, feeling in his pocket for a book. But she would answer\n",
      "him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon her\n",
      "tongue and to say, Oh, yes, Frisk. I'll call him Frisk. She wanted\n",
      "even to say, Was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone?\n",
      "But try as she might, she could think of nothing to say like that,\n",
      "fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her father,\n",
      "unsuspected by James, a private token of the love she felt for him.\n",
      "For she thought, dabbling her hand (and now Macalister's boy had caught\n",
      "a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with blood on its gills)\n",
      "for she thought, looking at James who kept his eyes dispassionately on\n",
      "the sail, or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon, you're\n",
      "not exposed to it, to this pressure and division of feeling, this\n",
      "extraordinary temptation. Her father was feeling in his pockets; in\n",
      "another second, he would have found his book. For no one attracted her\n",
      "more; his hands were beautiful, and his feet, and his voice, and his\n",
      "words, and his haste, and his temper, and his oddity, and his passion,\n",
      "and his saying straight out before every one, we perish, each alone,\n",
      "and his remoteness. (He had opened his book.) But what remained\n",
      "intolerable, she thought, sitting upright, and watching Macalister's\n",
      "boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish, was that crass\n",
      "blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and\n",
      "raised bitter storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling\n",
      "with rage and remembered some command of his; some insolence: \"Do\n",
      "this,\" \"Do that,\" his dominance: his \"Submit to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she said nothing, but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore,\n",
      "wrapped in its mantle of peace; as if the people there had fallen\n",
      "asleep, she thought; were free like smoke, were free to come and go\n",
      "like ghosts. They have no suffering there, she thought.\n",

      "Yes, that is their boat, Lily Briscoe decided, standing on the edge of\n",
      "the lawn. It was the boat with greyish-brown sails, which she saw now\n",
      "flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay. There he\n",
      "sits, she thought, and the children are quite silent still. And she\n",
      "could not reach him either. The sympathy she had not given him weighed\n",

      "\n",
      "She had always found him difficult. She never had been able to praise\n",

      "back, reluctantly again, to her canvas. Heaven be praised for it, the\n",
      "problem of space remained, she thought, taking up her brush again. It\n",
      "glared at her. The whole mass of the picture was poised upon that\n",
      "weight. Beautiful and bright it should be on the surface, feathery and\n",
      "evanescent, one colour melting into another like the colours on a\n",
      "butterfly's wing; but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with\n",
      "bolts of iron. It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath;\n",
      "and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses. And she began\n",
      "to lay on a red, a grey, and she began to model her way into the hollow\n",
      "there. At the same time, she seemed to be sitting beside Mrs. Ramsay on\n",
      "the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it a boat? Is it a cask?\" Mrs. Ramsay said. And she began hunting\n",
      "round for her spectacles. And she sat, having found them, silent,\n",
      "looking out to sea. And Lily, painting steadily, felt as if a door had\n",
      "opened, and one went in and stood gazing silently about in a high\n",
      "cathedral-like place, very dark, very solemn. Shouts came from a world\n",
      "far away. Steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon.\n",
      "Charles threw stones and sent them skipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay sat silent. She was glad, Lily thought, to rest in silence,\n",
      "uncommunicative; to rest in the extreme obscurity of human\n",
      "relationships. Who knows what we are, what we feel? Who knows even at\n",
      "the moment of intimacy, This is knowledge? Aren't things spoilt then,\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay may have asked (it seemed to have happened so often, this\n",
      "silence by her side) by saying them? Aren't we more expressive thus?\n",
      "The moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile. She rammed a\n",
      "little hole in the sand and covered it up, by way of burying in it the\n",
      "perfection of the moment. It was like a drop of silver in which one\n",
      "dipped and illumined the darkness of the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily stepped back to get her canvas--so--into perspective. It was an\n",
      "odd road to be walking, this of painting. Out and out one went,\n",
      "further, until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank, perfectly\n",
      "alone, over the sea. And as she dipped into the blue paint, she\n",
      "dipped too into the past there. Now Mrs. Ramsay got up, she\n",
      "remembered. It was time to go back to the house--time for\n",
      "luncheon. And they all walked up from the beach together, she walking\n",
      "behind with William Bankes, and there was Minta in front of them with a\n",
      "hole in her stocking. How that little round hole of pink heel seemed\n",
      "to flaunt itself before them! How William Bankes deplored it, without,\n",
      "so far as she could remember, saying anything about it! It meant to\n",
      "him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants\n",
      "leaving and beds not made at mid-day--all the things he most abhorred.\n",
      "He had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover\n",
      "an unsightly object which he did now--holding his hand in front of\n",
      "him. And Minta walked on ahead, and presumably Paul met her and she\n",
      "went off with Paul in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rayleys, thought Lily Briscoe, squeezing her tube of green paint.\n",
      "She collected her impressions of the Rayleys. Their lives appeared to\n",
      "her in a series of scenes; one, on the staircase at dawn. Paul had\n",
      "come in and gone to bed early; Minta was late. There was Minta,\n",
      "wreathed, tinted, garish on the stairs about three o'clock in the\n",
      "morning. Paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of\n",
      "burglars. Minta was eating a sandwich, standing half-way up by a\n",
      "window, in the cadaverous early morning light, and the carpet had a\n",
      "hole in it. But what did they say? Lily asked herself, as if by\n",
      "looking she could hear them. Minta went on eating her sandwich,\n",
      "annoyingly, while he spoke something violent, abusing her, in a mutter\n",
      "so as not to wake the children, the two little boys. He was withered,\n",
      "drawn; she flamboyant, careless. For things had worked loose after the\n",
      "first year or so; the marriage had turned out rather badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this, Lily thought, taking the green paint on her brush, this\n",
      "making up scenes about them, is what we call \"knowing\" people,\n",
      "\"thinking\" of them, \"being fond\" of them! Not a word of it was true;\n",
      "she had made it up; but it was what she knew them by all the same. She\n",
      "went on tunnelling her way into her picture, into the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, Paul said he \"played chess in coffee-houses.\" She had\n",
      "built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too. She\n",
      "remembered how, as he said it, she thought how he rang up the servant,\n",
      "and she said, \"Mrs. Rayley's out, sir,\" and he decided that he would not\n",
      "come home either. She saw him sitting in the corner of some lugubrious\n",
      "place where the smoke attached itself to the red plush seats, and the\n",
      "waitresses got to know you, and he played chess with a little man who\n",
      "was in the tea trade and lived at Surbiton, but that was all Paul knew\n",
      "about him. And then Minta was out when he came home and then there was\n",
      "that scene on the stairs, when he got the poker in case of burglars (no\n",
      "doubt to frighten her too) and spoke so bitterly, saying she had ruined\n",
      "his life. At any rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near\n",
      "Rickmansworth, things were horribly strained. Paul took her down the\n",
      "garden to look at the Belgian hares which he bred, and Minta followed\n",
      "them, singing, and put her bare arm on his shoulder, lest he should\n",
      "tell her anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minta was bored by hares, Lily thought. But Minta never gave herself\n",
      "away. She never said things like that about playing chess in coffee-\n",
      "houses. She was far too conscious, far too wary. But to go on with\n",
      "their story--they had got through the dangerous stage by now. She had\n",
      "been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and\n",
      "Minta had to hand him his tools. He sat on the road mending the car,\n",
      "and it was the way she gave him the tools--business-like,\n",
      "straightforward, friendly--that proved it was all right now. They were\n",
      "\"in love\" no longer; no, he had taken up with another woman, a serious\n",
      "woman, with her hair in a plait and a case in her hand (Minta had\n",
      "described her gratefully, almost admiringly), who went to meetings and\n",
      "shared Paul's views (they had got more and more pronounced) about the\n",
      "taxation of land values and a capital levy. Far from breaking up the\n",
      "marriage, that alliance had righted it. They were excellent friends,\n",
      "obviously, as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that was the story of the Rayleys, Lily thought. She imagined\n",
      "herself telling it to Mrs. Ramsay, who would be full of curiosity to\n",
      "know what had become of the Rayleys. She would feel a little\n",
      "triumphant, telling Mrs. Ramsay that the marriage had not been a\n",
      "success.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the dead, thought Lily, encountering some obstacle in her design\n",
      "which made her pause and ponder, stepping back a foot or so, oh, the\n",
      "dead! she murmured, one pitied them, one brushed them aside, one had\n",
      "even a little contempt for them. They are at our mercy. Mrs. Ramsay\n",
      "has faded and gone, she thought. We can over-ride her wishes, improve\n",
      "away her limited, old-fashioned ideas. She recedes further and further\n",
      "from us. Mockingly she seemed to see her there at the end of the\n",
      "corridor of years saying, of all incongruous things, \"Marry, marry!\"\n",
      "(sitting very upright early in the morning with the birds beginning to\n",
      "cheep in the garden outside). And one would have to say to her, It has\n",
      "all gone against your wishes. They're happy like that; I'm happy like\n",
      "this. Life has changed completely. At that all her being, even her\n",
      "beauty, became for a moment, dusty and out of date. For a moment Lily,\n",
      "standing there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the Rayleys,\n",
      "triumphed over Mrs. Ramsay, who would never know how Paul went to\n",
      "coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and Minta\n",
      "handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never married,\n",
      "not even William Bankes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay had planned it. Perhaps, had she lived, she would have\n",
      "compelled it. Already that summer he was \"the kindest of men.\" He was\n",
      "\"the first scientist of his age, my husband says.\" He was also \"poor\n",
      "William--it makes me so unhappy, when I go to see him, to find nothing\n",
      "nice in his house--no one to arrange the flowers.\" So they were sent\n",
      "for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony\n",
      "that made Mrs. Ramsay slip through one's fingers, that she had a\n",
      "scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was so exact. What was this\n",
      "mania of hers for marriage? Lily wondered, stepping to and fro from\n",
      "her easel.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish light\n",
      "seemed to burn in her mind, covering Paul Rayley, issuing from him. It\n",
      "rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a\n",
      "distant beach. She heard the roar and the crackle. The whole sea for\n",
      "miles round ran red and gold. Some winey smell mixed with it and\n",
      "intoxicated her, for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw\n",
      "herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a\n",
      "beach. And the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and\n",
      "disgust, as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it\n",
      "fed on the treasure of the house, greedily, disgustingly, and she\n",
      "loathed it. But for a sight, for a glory it surpassed everything in\n",
      "her experience, and burnt year after year like a signal fire on a\n",
      "desert island at the edge of the sea, and one had only to say \"in love\"\n",
      "and instantly, as happened now, up rose Paul's fire again. And it sank\n",

      "coffee-houses and played chess.)\n",
      "\n",
      "She had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though, she thought. She\n",
      "had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had flashed upon her that\n",
      "she would move the tree to the middle, and need never marry anybody,\n",
      "and she had felt an enormous exultation. She had felt, now she could\n",
      "stand up to Mrs. Ramsay--a tribute to the astonishing power that Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay had over one. Do this, she said, and one did it. Even her\n",
      "shadow at the window with James was full of authority. She remembered\n",
      "how William Bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance\n",
      "of mother and son. Did she not admire their beauty? he said. But\n",
      "William, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes\n",
      "when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed\n",
      "a shadow there and so on. She did not intend to disparage a subject\n",
      "which, they agreed, Raphael had treated divinely. She was not cynical.\n",
      "Quite the contrary. Thanks to his scientific mind he understood--a\n",
      "proof of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted\n",
      "her enormously. One could talk of painting then seriously to a man.\n",
      "Indeed, his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life. She\n",

      "gentleman he was, plenty of time to wash her hands, while he strolled\n",
      "by the river. That was typical of their relationship. Many things were\n",
      "left unsaid. Then they strolled through the courtyards, and admired,\n",
      "summer after summer, the proportions and the flowers, and he would tell\n",
      "her things, about perspective, about architecture, as they walked, and\n",
      "he would stop to look at a tree, or the view over the lake, and admire\n",
      "a child--(it was his great grief--he had no daughter) in the vague aloof\n",

      "laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to dazzle him,\n",
      "so that he walked slowly, lifted his hand to screen his eyes and\n",
      "paused, with his head thrown back, merely to breathe the air. Then\n",
      "he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday; he must\n",

      "buy a new carpet for the staircase. And once something led him to talk\n",
      "about the Ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had\n",
      "been wearing a grey hat; she was not more than nineteen or twenty. She\n",
      "was astonishingly beautiful. There he stood looking down the avenue at\n",
      "Hampton Court as if he could see her there among the fountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked now at the drawing-room step. She saw, through William's\n",
      "eyes, the shape of a woman, peaceful and silent, with downcast eyes.\n",
      "She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day, Lily thought).\n",
      "Her eyes were bent. She would never lift them. Yes, thought Lily,\n",
      "looking intently, I must have seen her look like that, but not in grey;\n",
      "nor so still, nor so young, nor so peaceful. The figure came readily\n",
      "enough. She was astonishingly beautiful, as William said. But beauty\n",
      "was not everything. Beauty had this penalty--it came too readily, came\n",
      "too completely. It stilled life--froze it. One forgot the little\n",
      "agitations; the flush, the pallor, some queer distortion, some light or\n",
      "shadow, which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a\n",
      "quality one saw for ever after. It was simpler to smooth that all out\n",
      "under the cover of beauty. But what was the look she had, Lily\n",
      "wondered, when she clapped her deer-stalkers's hat on her head, or ran\n",
      "across the grass, or scolded Kennedy, the gardener? Who could tell\n",
      "her? Who could help her?\n",
      "\n",
      "Against her will she had come to the surface, and found herself half\n",
      "out of the picture, looking, little dazedly, as if at unreal things, at\n",
      "Mr. Carmichael. He lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his\n",
      "paunch not reading, or sleeping, but basking like a creature gorged\n",
      "with existence. His book had fallen on to the grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to go straight up to him and say, \"Mr. Carmichael!\" Then he\n",
      "would look up benevolently as always, from his smoky vague green eyes.\n",
      "But one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them.\n",
      "And she wanted to say not one thing, but everything. Little words that\n",
      "broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing. \"About life,\n",
      "about death; about Mrs. Ramsay\"--no, she thought, one could say\n",
      "nothing to nobody. The urgency of the moment always missed its mark.\n",
      "Words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low. Then\n",
      "one gave it up; then the idea sunk back again; then one became like\n",
      "most middle-aged people, cautious, furtive, with wrinkles between the\n",
      "eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension. For how could one express\n",
      "in words these emotions of the body? express that emptiness there?\n",
      "(She was looking at the drawing-room steps; they looked extraordinarily\n",
      "empty.) It was one's body feeling, not one's mind. The physical\n",

      "which sat by the boat, that abstract one made of her, that woman in\n",
      "grey, as if to abuse her for having gone, and then having gone, come\n",

      "basin of reality, and one could almost fancy that had Mr. Carmichael\n",
      "spoken, for instance, a little tear would have rent the surface pool.\n",

      "something incongruous. There was a brown spot in the middle of the\n",

      "So fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that\n",
      "the sea and sky looked all one fabric, as if sails were stuck high up\n",
      "in the sky, or the clouds had dropped down into the sea. A steamer far\n",
      "out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll of smoke which stayed\n",
      "there curving and circling decoratively, as if the air were a fine\n",
      "gauze which held things and kept them softly in its mesh, only gently\n",
      "swaying them this way and that. And as happens sometimes when the\n",

      "swirls and streaks into patterns and, numbed and shrouded, wandered in\n",

      "the world became full of little creaking and squeaking sounds. One\n",

      "to stand still. The Lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the\n",
      "distant shore became fixed. The sun grew hotter and everybody seemed\n",
      "to come very close together and to feel each other's presence, which\n",
      "they had almost forgotten. Macalister's fishing line went plumb down\n",
      "into the sea. But Mr. Ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover's\n",

      "his father to the heart. Only now, as he grew older, and sat\n",
      "staring at his father in an  impotent rage, it was not him, that old\n",
      "man reading, whom he wanted to kill, but it was the thing that\n",
      "descended on him--without his knowing it perhaps: that fierce sudden\n",
      "black-winged harpy, with its talons and its beak all cold and hard,\n",
      "that struck and struck at you (he could feel the beak on his bare legs,\n",
      "where it had struck when he was a child) and then made off, and there\n",
      "he was again, an old man, very sad, reading his book. That he would\n",
      "kill, that he would strike to the heart. Whatever he did--(and he\n",

      "shore) whether he was in a business, in a bank, a barrister, a man at\n",
      "the head of some enterprise, that he would fight, that he would track\n",
      "down and stamp out--tyranny, despotism, he called it--making people\n",

      "could any of them say, But I won't, when he said, Come to the\n",
      "Lighthouse. Do this. Fetch me that. The black wings spread, and the\n",
      "hard beak tore. And then next moment, there he sat reading his book;\n",
      "and he might look up--one never knew--quite reasonably. He might talk\n",
      "to the Macalisters. He might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen\n",
      "old woman's hand in the street, James thought, and he might be shouting\n",
      "out at some fisherman's sports; he might be waving his arms in the air\n",
      "with excitement. Or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent\n",
      "from one end of dinner to the other. Yes, thought James, while the\n",
      "boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun; there was a waste of\n",
      "snow and rock very lonely and austere; and there he had come to feel,\n",
      "quite often lately, when his father said something or did something\n",
      "which surprised the others, there were two pairs of footprints only;\n",
      "his own and his father's. They alone knew each other. What then was\n",
      "this terror, this hatred? Turning back among the many leaves\n",
      "which the past had folded in him, peering into the heart of that\n",
      "forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape\n",
      "is distorted, and one blunders, now with the sun in one's eyes,\n",
      "now with a dark shadow, he sought an image to cool and detach and round\n",
      "off his feeling in a concrete shape. Suppose then that as a child\n",
      "sitting helpless in a perambulator, or on some one's knee, he had seen\n",
      "a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently, some one's foot? Suppose he\n",
      "had seen the foot first, in the grass, smooth, and whole; then the\n",
      "wheel; and the same foot, purple, crushed. But the wheel was innocent.\n",
      "So now, when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up\n",
      "early in the morning to go to the Lighthouse down it came over his\n",
      "foot, over Cam's foot, over anybody's foot. One sat and watched it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whose foot was he thinking of, and in what garden did all this\n",
      "happen? For one had settings for these scenes; trees that grew there;\n",
      "flowers; a certain light; a few figures. Everything tended to set\n",
      "itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom. None of this\n",
      "throwing of hands about; people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice.\n",
      "They went in and out all day long. There was an old woman gossiping in\n",
      "the kitchen; and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze; all\n",
      "was blowing, all was growing; and over all those plates and bowls and\n",
      "tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would\n",
      "be drawn, like a vine leaf, at night. Things became stiller and darker\n",
      "at night. But the leaf-like veil was so fine, that lights lifted it,\n",
      "voices crinkled it; he could see through it a figure stooping, hear,\n",
      "coming close, going away, some dress rustling, some chain tinkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in this world that the wheel went over the person's foot.\n",
      "Something, he remembered, stayed flourished up in the air, something\n",
      "arid and sharp descended even there, like a blade, a scimitar, smiting\n",
      "through the leaves and flowers even of that happy world and making it\n",
      "shrivel and fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will rain,\" he remembered his father saying. \"You won't be able to\n",

      "\n",
      "The Lighthouse was then a silvery, misty-looking tower with a yellow\n",

      "\n",
      "James looked at the Lighthouse. He could see the white-washed rocks;\n",

      "black and white; he could see windows in it; he could even see washing\n",
      "spread on the rocks to dry. So that was the Lighthouse, was it?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the other was also the Lighthouse. For nothing was simply one\n",
      "thing. The other Lighthouse was true too. It was sometimes hardly to\n",
      "be seen across the bay. In the evening one looked up and saw the eye\n",
      "opening and shutting and the light seemed to reach them in that airy\n",
      "sunny garden where they sat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he pulled himself up. Whenever he said \"they\" or \"a person,\" and\n",
      "then began hearing the rustle of some one coming, the tinkle of some\n",
      "one going, he became extremely sensitive to the presence of whoever\n",
      "might be in the room. It was his father now. The strain was acute.\n",
      "For in one moment if there was no breeze, his father would slap the\n",
      "covers of his book together, and say: \"What's happening now? What are\n",
      "we dawdling about here for, eh?\" as, once before he had brought his\n",
      "blade down among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over,\n",
      "and if there had been an axe handy, a knife, or anything with a sharp\n",
      "point he would have seized it and struck his father through the heart.\n",
      "She had gone stiff all over, and then, her arm slackening, so that he\n",
      "felt she listened to him no longer, she had risen somehow and gone away\n",
      "and left him there, impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping\n",
      "a pair of scissors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a breath of wind blew. The water chuckled and gurgled in the\n",
      "bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and\n",
      "down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them. At any moment\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay (he scarcely dared look at him) might rouse himself, shut his\n",
      "book, and say something sharp; but for the moment he was reading, so\n",
      "that James stealthily, as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet,\n",
      "afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board, went on thinking what\n",
      "was she like, where did she go that day? He began following her from\n",
      "room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light, as\n",
      "if the reflection came from many china dishes, she talked to somebody;\n",
      "he listened to her talking. She talked to a servant, saying simply\n",
      "whatever came into her head. She alone spoke the truth; to her alone\n",
      "could he speak it. That was the source of her everlasting attraction\n",
      "for him, perhaps; she was a person to whom one could say what came into\n",
      "one's head. But all the time he thought of her, he was conscious of\n",
      "his father following his thought, surveying it, making it shiver and\n",
      "falter. At last he ceased to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun, staring at the\n",
      "Lighthouse, powerless to move, powerless to flick off these grains of\n",
      "misery which settled on his mind one after another. A rope seemed to\n",
      "bind him there, and his father had knotted it and he could only escape\n",
      "by taking a knife and plunging it... But at that moment the sail\n",
      "swung slowly round, filled slowly out, the boat seemed to shake\n",
      "herself, and then to move off half conscious in her sleep, and then she\n",
      "woke and shot through the waves. The relief was extraordinary. They\n",
      "all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their\n",
      "ease, and the fishing-lines slanted taut across the side of the\n",
      "boat. But his father did not rouse himself. He only raised his right\n",

      "slightly and the boats altered their positions, the view, which a\n",

      "The disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own mind.\n",

      "\n",
      "What was the problem then? She must try to get hold of something tht\n",

      "Beautiful pictures. Beautiful phrases. But what she wished to get hold\n",
      "of was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been\n",

      "she said desperately, pitching herself firmly again before her easel.\n",
      "It was a miserable machine, an inefficient machine, she thought, the\n",
      "human apparatus for painting or for feeling; it always broke down at\n",
      "the critical moment; heroically, one must force it on. She stared,\n",
      "frowning. There was the hedge, sure enough. But one got nothing by\n",
      "soliciting urgently. One got only a glare in the eye from looking at\n",
      "the line of the wall, or from thinking--she wore a grey hat. She was\n",
      "astonishingly beautiful. Let it come, she thought, if it will come.\n",
      "For there are moments when one can neither think nor feel. And if\n",

      "\n",
      "Here on the grass, on the ground, she thought, sitting down, and\n",

      "was very rough. Here sitting on the world, she thought, for she could\n",
      "not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was\n",
      "happening for the first time, perhaps for the last time, as a\n",
      "traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking out of the\n",
      "train window, that he must look now, for he will never see that town,\n",
      "or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the fields, again. The\n",

      "station, she thought, looking at old Mr. Carmichael, who seemed (though\n",
      "they had not said a word all this time) to share her thoughts. And she\n",
      "would never see him again perhaps. He was growing old. Also, she\n",
      "remembered, smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot, he was\n",
      "growing famous. People said that his poetry was \"so beautiful.\" They\n",
      "went and published things he had written forty years ago. There was a\n",
      "famous man now called Carmichael, she smiled, thinking how many shapes\n",
      "one person might wear, how he was that in the newspapers, but here the\n",
      "same as he had always been. He looked the same--greyer, rather.\n",
      "Yes, he looked the same, but somebody had said, she recalled, that when\n",
      "he had heard of Andrew Ramsay's death (he was killed in a second by a\n",
      "shell; he should have been a great mathematician) Mr. Carmichael had\n",
      "\"lost all interest in life.\" What did it mean--that? she wondered. Had\n",
      "he marched through Trafalgar Square grasping a big stick? Had he\n",
      "turned pages over and over, without reading them, sitting in his room\n",
      "in St. John's Wood alone? She did not know what he had done, when he\n",
      "heard that Andrew was killed, but she felt it in him all the same.\n",
      "They only mumbled at each other on staircases; they looked up at the\n",
      "sky and said it will be fine or it won't be fine. But this was one way\n",
      "of knowing people, she thought: to know the outline, not the detail, to\n",
      "sit in one's garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple\n",
      "down into the distant heather. She knew him in that way. She knew\n",
      "that he had changed somehow. She had never read a line of his poetry.\n",
      "She thought that she knew how it went though, slowly and sonorously.\n",
      "It was seasoned and mellow. It was about the desert and the camel. It\n",
      "was about the palm tree and the sunset. It was extremely impersonal;\n",
      "it said something about death; it said very little about love. There\n",
      "was an impersonality about him. He wanted very little of other people.\n",
      "Had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing-room window\n",
      "with some newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid Mrs. Ramsay whom for\n",
      "some reason he did not much like? On that account, of course, she\n",
      "would always try to make him stop. He would bow to her. He would halt\n",
      "unwillingly and bow profoundly. Annoyed that he did not want anything\n",
      "of her, Mrs. Ramsay would ask him (Lily could hear her) wouldn't he like\n",
      "a coat, a rug, a newspaper? No, he wanted nothing. (Here he bowed.)\n",
      "There was some quality in her which he did not much like. It was\n",
      "perhaps her masterfulness, her positiveness, something matter-of-fact\n",
      "in her. She was so direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "(A noise drew her attention to the drawing-room window--the squeak of a\n",
      "hinge. The light breeze was toying with the window.)\n",
      "\n",
      "There must have been people who disliked her very much, Lily thought\n",
      "(Yes; she realised that the drawing-room step was empty, but it had no\n",
      "effect on her whatever. She did not want Mrs. Ramsay now.)--People who\n",
      "thought her too sure, too drastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, her beauty offended people probably. How monotonous, they would\n",
      "say, and the same always! They preferred another type--the dark, the\n",
      "vivacious. Then she was weak with her husband. She let him make those\n",
      "scenes. Then she was reserved. Nobody knew exactly what had happened\n",
      "to her. And (to go back to Mr. Carmichael and his dislike) one could not\n",
      "imagine Mrs. Ramsay standing painting, lying reading, a whole morning on\n",
      "the lawn. It was unthinkable. Without saying a word, the only token of\n",
      "her errand a basket on her arm, she went off to the town, to the poor,\n",
      "to sit in some stuffy little bedroom. Often and often Lily had seen\n",
      "her go silently in the midst of some game, some discussion, with her\n",
      "basket on her arm, very upright. She had noted her return. She had\n",
      "thought, half laughing (she was so methodical with the tea cups), half\n",
      "moved (her beauty took one's breath away), eyes that are closing in\n",
      "pain have looked on you. You have been with them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Mrs. Ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late, or the\n",
      "butter not fresh, or the teapot chipped. And all the time she was\n",
      "saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of Greek\n",
      "temples, and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little\n",
      "room. She never talked of it--she went, punctually, directly. It was\n",
      "her instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows for the south, the\n",
      "artichokes for the sun, turning her infallibly to the human race,\n",
      "making her nest in its heart. And this, like all instincts, was a\n",
      "little distressing to people who did not share it; to Mr. Carmichael\n",
      "perhaps, to herself certainly. Some notion was in both of them about\n",
      "the ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of thought. Her going was\n",
      "a reproach to them, gave a different twist to the world, so that they\n",
      "were led to protest, seeing their own prepossessions disappear, and\n",
      "clutch at them vanishing. Charles Tansley did that too: it was part of\n",
      "the reason why one disliked him. He upset the proportions of one's\n",
      "world. And what had happened to him, she wondered, idly stirring the\n",
      "platains with her brush. He had got his fellowship. He had married;\n",
      "he lived at Golder's Green.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had gone one day into a Hall and heard him speaking during the war.\n",
      "He was denouncing something: he was condemning somebody. He was\n",
      "preaching brotherly love. And all she felt was how could he love his\n",
      "kind who did not know one picture from another, who had stood behind\n",
      "her smoking shag (\"fivepence an ounce, Miss Briscoe\") and making it his\n",
      "business to tell her women can't write, women can't paint, not so much\n",
      "that he believed it, as that for some odd reason he wished it? There\n",
      "he was lean and red and raucous, preaching love from a platform (there\n",
      "were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with\n",
      "her brush--red, energetic, shiny ants, rather like Charles Tansley).\n",
      "She had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half-empty hall,\n",
      "pumping love into that chilly space, and suddenly, there was the old\n",
      "cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and Mrs.\n",
      "Ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles. \"Oh, dear!\n",
      "What a nuisance! Lost again. Don't bother, Mr. Tansley. I lose\n",
      "thousands every summer,\" at which he pressed his chin back against his\n",
      "collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could stand it\n",
      "in her whom he liked, and smiled very charmingly. He must have\n",
      "confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got\n",
      "separated and walked back alone. He was educating his little sister,\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay had told her. It was immensely to his credit. Her own idea\n",
      "of him was grotesque, Lily knew well, stirring the plantains with her\n",
      "brush. Half one's notions of other people were, after all, grotesque.\n",
      "They served private purposes of one's own. He did for her instead of a\n",
      "whipping-boy. She found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she\n",
      "was out of temper. If she wanted to be serious about him she had to\n",
      "help herself to Mrs. Ramsay's sayings, to look at him through her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "She raised a little mountain for the ants to climb over. She reduced\n",
      "them to a frenzy of indecision by this interference in their cosmogony.\n",
      "Some ran this way, others that.\n",
      "\n",
      "One wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with, she reflected. Fifty pairs\n",
      "of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with, she thought.\n",
      "Among them, must be one that was stone blind to her beauty. One wanted\n",
      "most some secret sense, fine as air, with which to steal through\n",
      "keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting, talking, sitting\n",
      "silent in the window alone; which took to itself and treasured up like\n",
      "the air which held the smoke of the steamer, her thoughts, her\n",
      "imaginations, her desires. What did the hedge mean to her, what did\n",
      "the garden mean to her, what did it mean to her when a wave broke?\n",
      "(Lily looked up, as she had seen Mrs. Ramsay look up; she too heard a\n",
      "wave falling on the beach.) And then what stirred and trembled in her\n",
      "mind when the children cried, \"How's that? How's that?\" cricketing?\n",
      "She would stop knitting for a second. She would look intent. Then she\n",
      "would lapse again, and suddenly Mr. Ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in\n",
      "front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to\n",
      "rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he\n",
      "stood over her and looked down at her. Lily could see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair. It seemed\n",
      "somehow as if he had done it before; as if he had once bent in the same\n",
      "way and raised her from a boat which, lying a few inches off some\n",
      "island, had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by\n",
      "the gentlemen. An old-fashioned scene that was, which required,\n",
      "very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers. Letting herself be\n",
      "helped by him, Mrs. Ramsay had thought (Lily supposed) the time\n",
      "has come now. Yes, she would say it now. Yes, she would marry him.\n",
      "And she stepped slowly, quietly on shore. Probably she said one\n",
      "word only, letting her hand rest still in his. I will marry you,\n",
      "she might have said, with her hand in his; but no more. Time\n",
      "after time the same thrill had passed between them--obviously it\n",
      "had, Lily thought, smoothing a way for her ants. She was not\n",
      "inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something she had been\n",
      "given years ago folded up; something she had seen. For in the rough\n",
      "and tumble of daily life, with all those children about, all those\n",
      "visitors, one had constantly a sense of repetition--of one thing\n",
      "falling where another had fallen, and so setting up an echo which\n",
      "chimed in the air and made it full of vibrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it would be a mistake, she thought, thinking how they walked off\n",
      "together, arm in arm, past the greenhouse, to simplify their\n",
      "relationship. It was no monotony of bliss--she with her impulses and\n",
      "quicknesses; he with his shudders and glooms. Oh, no. The bedroom door\n",
      "would slam violently early in the morning. He would start from the\n",
      "table in a temper. He would whizz his plate through the window. Then\n",
      "all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and\n",
      "blinds fluttering, as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded\n",
      "about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship-\n",
      "shape. She had met Paul Rayley like that one day on the stairs.\n",
      "They had laughed and laughed, like a couple of children, all because\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay, finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the\n",
      "whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside. 'An earwig,\n",
      "Prue murmured, awestruck, 'in his milk.' Other people might find\n",
      "centipedes. But he had built round him such a fence of sanctity, and\n",
      "occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig\n",
      "in his milk was a monster.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it tired Mrs. Ramsay, it cowed her a little--the plates whizzing\n",
      "and the doors slamming. And there would fall between them sometimes\n",
      "long rigid silences, when, in a state of mind which annoyed Lily\n",
      "in her, half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed unable to surmount\n",
      "the tempest calmly, or to laugh as they laughed, but in her weariness\n",
      "perhaps concealed something. She brooded and sat silent. After a\n",
      "time he would hang stealthily about the places where she was--roaming\n",
      "under the window where she sat writing letters or talking, for she\n",
      "would take care to be busy when he passed, and evade him, and pretend\n",
      "not to see him. Then he would turn smooth as silk, affable, urbane,\n",
      "and try to win her so. Still she would hold off, and now she would\n",
      "assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due\n",
      "of her beauty which she was generally utterly without; would turn\n",
      "her head; would look so, over her shoulder, always with some\n",
      "Minta, Paul, or William Bankes at her side. At length, standing\n",
      "outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound (Lily got up\n",
      "off the grass and stood looking at the steps, at the window, where she\n",
      "had seen him), he would say her name, once only, for all the world like\n",
      "a wolf barking in the snow, but still she held back; and he would say\n",
      "it once more, and this time something in the tone would rouse her, and\n",
      "she would go to him, leaving them all of a sudden, and they would walk\n",
      "off together among the pear trees, the cabbages, and the raspberry\n",
      "beds. They would have it out together. But with what attitudes and\n",
      "with what words? Such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that,\n",
      "turning away, she and Paul and Minta would hide their curiosity and\n",
      "their discomfort, and begin picking flowers, throwing balls,\n",
      "chattering, until it was time for dinner, and there they were, he at\n",
      "one end of the table, she at the other, as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't some of you take up botany?.. With all those legs and arms\n",
      "why doesn't one of you...?\" So they would talk as usual, laughing,\n",
      "among the children. All would be as usual, save only for some quiver,\n",
      "as of a blade in the air, which came and went between them as if\n",
      "the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates\n",
      "had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and\n",
      "the cabbages. Especially, Lily thought, Mrs. Ramsay would glance at\n",
      "Prue. She sat in the middle between brothers and sisters, always\n",
      "occupied, it seemed, seeing that nothing went wrong so that she\n",
      "scarcely spoke herself. How Prue must have blamed herself for that\n",
      "earwig in the milk How white she had gone when Mr. Ramsay threw his\n",
      "plate through the window! How she drooped under those long silences\n",
      "between them! Anyhow, her mother now would seem to be making it up to\n",
      "her; assuring her that everything was well; promising her that one of\n",
      "these days that same happiness would be hers. She had enjoyed it for\n",
      "less than a year, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had let the flowers fall from her basket, Lily thought, screwing up\n",
      "her eyes and standing back as if to look at her picture, which she was\n",
      "not touching, however, with all her faculties in a trance, frozen over\n",
      "superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She let her flowers fall from her basket, scattered and tumbled them on\n",
      "to the grass and, reluctantly and hesitatingly, but without question or\n",
      "complaint--had she not the faculty of obedience to perfection?--went\n",
      "too. Down fields, across valleys, white, flower-strewn--that was\n",
      "how she would have painted it. The hills were austere. It was rocky;\n",
      "it was steep. The waves sounded hoarse on the stones beneath. They\n",
      "went, the three of them together, Mrs. Ramsay walking rather fast in\n",
      "front, as if she expected to meet some one round the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light\n",
      "stuff behind it. At last then somebody had come into the drawing-room;\n",
      "somebody was sitting in the chair. For Heaven's sake, she prayed, let\n",
      "them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her.\n",
      "Mercifully, whoever it was stayed still inside; had settled by some\n",
      "stroke of luck so as to throw an odd-shaped triangular shadow over the\n",
      "step. It altered the composition of the picture a little. It was\n",
      "interesting. It might be useful. Her mood was coming back to her. One\n",
      "must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of\n",
      "emotion, the determination not to be put off, not to be bamboozled.\n",
      "One must hold the scene--so--in a vise and let nothing come in and\n",
      "spoil it. One wanted, she thought, dipping her brush deliberately, to\n",
      "be on a level with ordinary experience, to feel simply that's a chair,\n",
      "that's a table, and yet at the same time, It's a miracle, it's an\n",
      "ecstasy. The problem might be solved after all. Ah, but what had\n",
      "happened? Some wave of white went over the window pane. The air must\n",
      "have stirred some flounce in the room. Her heart leapt at her and\n",
      "seized her and tortured her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!\" she cried, feeling the old horror come\n",
      "back--to want and want and not to have. Could she inflict that still?\n",
      "And then, quietly, as if she refrained, that too became part of\n",
      "ordinary experience, was on a level with the chair, with the table.\n",
      "Mrs. Ramsay--it was part of her perfect goodness--sat there quite\n",
      "simply, in the chair, flicked her needles to and fro, knitted her\n",

      "One could see lines and creases in the rocks. One could see the\n",
      "windows clearly; a dab of white on one of them, and a little tuft of\n",
      "green on the rock. A man had come out and looked at them through a\n",

      "Lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years; it was a stark\n",
      "tower on a bare rock. It satisfied him. It confirmed some obscure\n",
      "feeling of his about his own character. The old ladies, he thought,\n",
      "thinking of the garden at home, went dragging their chairs about on the\n",

      "to be so happy, but as a matter of fact, James thought, looking at the\n",
      "Lighthouse stood there on its rock, it's like that. He looked at his\n",
      "father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight. They shared that\n",
      "knowledge. \"We are driving before a gale--we must sink,\" he began\n",
      "saying to himself, half aloud, exactly as his father said it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody seemed to have spoken for an age. Cam was tired of looking at\n",
      "the sea. Little bits of black cork had floated past; the fish were\n",
      "dead in the bottom of the boat. Still her father read, and James\n",
      "looked at him and she looked at him, and they vowed that they would\n",
      "fight tyranny to the death, and he went on reading quite unconscious of\n",
      "what they thought. It was thus that he escaped, she thought. Yes,\n",
      "with his great forehead and his great nose, holding his little mottled\n",
      "book firmly in front of him, he escaped. You might try to lay hands on\n",
      "him, but then like a bird, he spread his wings, he floated off to\n",
      "settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump.\n",
      "She gazed at the immense expanse of the sea. The island had grown so\n",
      "small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer. It looked like\n",
      "the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover.\n",
      "Yet in its frailty were all those paths, those terraces, those bedrooms--\n",
      "all those innumberable things. But as, just before sleep, things\n",
      "simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has\n",
      "power to assert itself, so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island,\n",
      "all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing,\n",
      "and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this\n",
      "way and that across her mind. It was a hanging garden; it was a\n",
      "valley, full of birds, and flowers, and antelopes... She was falling\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come now,\" said Mr. Ramsay, suddenly shutting his book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come where? To what extraordinary adventure? She woke with a start.\n",
      "To land somewhere, to climb somewhere? Where was he leading them? For\n",
      "after his immense silence the words startled them. But it was absurd.\n",
      "He was hungry, he said. It was time for lunch. Besides, look, he\n",
      "said. \"There's the Lighthouse. We're almost there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's doing very well,\" said Macalister, praising James. \"He's keeping\n",
      "her very steady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But his father never praised him, James thought grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them.\n",
      "Now he was happy, eating bread and cheese with these fishermen. He\n",
      "would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour\n",
      "spitting with the other old men, James thought, watching him slice his\n",
      "cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is right, this is it, Cam kept feeling, as she peeled her hard-\n",
      "boiled egg. Now she felt as she did in the study when the old men were\n",
      "reading THE TIMES. Now I can go on thinking whatever I like, and I\n",
      "shan't fall over a precipice or be drowned, for there he is, keeping\n",
      "his eye on me, she thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it\n",
      "was very exciting--it seemed as if they were doing two things at once;\n",
      "they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making\n",
      "for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck. Would the water last?\n",
      "Would the provisions last? she asked herself, telling herself a story\n",
      "but knowing at the same time what was the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would soon be out of it, Mr. Ramsay was saying to old Macalister;\n",
      "but their children would see some strange things. Macalister said he\n",
      "was seventy-five last March; Mr. Ramsay was seventy-one. Macalister said\n",
      "he had never seen a doctor; he had never lost a tooth. And that's the\n",
      "way I'd like my children to live--Cam was sure that her father was\n",
      "thinking that, for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and\n",
      "told her, as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived,\n",
      "that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel. She\n",
      "should not waste it. He said it so wisely, as if he knew so well all\n",
      "the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once, and\n",
      "then he gave her, from his own parcel, a gingerbread nut, as if he were\n",
      "a great Spanish gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lady at a\n",
      "window (so courteous his manner was). He was shabby, and simple,\n",
      "eating bread and cheese; and yet he was leading them on a great\n",
      "expedition where, for all she knew, they would be drowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was where she sunk,\" said Macalister's boy suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three men were drowned where we are now, the old man said. He had seen\n",
      "them clinging to the mast himself. And Mr. Ramsay taking a look at the\n",
      "spot was about, James and Cam were afraid, to burst out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I beneath a rougher sea,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and if he did, they could not bear it; they would shriek aloud; they\n",
      "could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him;\n",
      "but to their surprise all he said was \"Ah\" as if he thought to himself.\n",
      "But why make a fuss about that? Naturally men are drowned in a storm,\n",
      "but it is a perfectly straightforward affair, and the depths of the sea\n",
      "(he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them) are only\n",
      "water after all. Then having lighted his pipe he took out his watch.\n",
      "He looked at it attentively; he made, perhaps, some mathematical\n",
      "calculation. At last he said, triumphantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well done!\" James had steered them like a born sailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "There! Cam thought, addressing herself silently to James. You've got\n",
      "it at last. For she knew that this was what James had been wanting,\n",
      "and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that he would not\n",
      "look at her or at his father or at any one. There he sat with his hand\n",
      "on the tiller sitting bolt upright, looking rather sulky and frowning\n",
      "slightly. He was so pleased that he was not going to let anybody share\n",
      "a grain of his pleasure. His father had praised him. They must think\n",
      "that he was perfectly indifferent. But you've got it now, Cam thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had tacked, and they were sailing swiftly, buoyantly on long\n",
      "rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an\n",
      "extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef. On the left a\n",
      "row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and\n",
      "became greener and on one, a higher rock, a wave incessantly broke\n",
      "and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower. One\n",
      "could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling drops and a\n",
      "kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves rolling and gambolling\n",
      "and slapping the rocks as if they were wild creatures who were\n",
      "perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and sported like this for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they could see two men on the Lighthouse, watching them and making\n",
      "ready to meet them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay buttoned his coat, and turned up his trousers. He took the\n",
      "large, badly packed, brown paper parcel which Nancy had got ready and\n",
      "sat with it on his knee. Thus in complete readiness to land he sat\n",
      "looking back at the island. With his long-sighted eyes perhaps he\n",
      "could see the dwindled leaf-like shape standing on end on a plate of\n",
      "gold quite clearly. What could he see? Cam wondered. It was all a\n",
      "blur to her. What was he thinking now? she wondered. What was it he\n",
      "sought, so fixedly, so intently, so silently? They watched him, both\n",
      "of them, sitting bareheaded with his parcel on his knee staring and\n",
      "staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like the vapour of\n",
      "something that had burnt itself away. What do you want? they both\n",
      "wanted to ask. They both wanted to say, Ask us anything and we will\n",
      "give it you. But he did not ask them anything. He sat and looked at\n",
      "the island and he might be thinking, We perished, each alone, or he\n",
      "might be thinking, I have reached it. I have found it; but he said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he put on his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring those parcels,\" he said, nodding his head at the things Nancy\n",
      "had done up for them to take to the Lighthouse. \"The parcels for the\n",
      "Lighthouse men,\" he said. He rose and stood in the bow of the boat,\n",
      "very straight and tall, for all the world, James thought, as if he were\n",
      "saying, \"There is no God,\" and Cam thought, as if he were leaping into\n",
      "space, and they both rose to follow him as he sprang, lightly like a\n",
      "young man, holding his parcel, on to the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must have reached it,\" said Lily Briscoe aloud, feeling suddenly\n",
      "completely tired out. For the Lighthouse had become almost invisible,\n",
      "had melted away into a blue haze, and the effort of looking at it and\n",
      "the effort of thinking of him landing there, which both seemed to be\n",
      "one and the same effort, had stretched her body and mind to the utmost.\n",
      "Ah, but she was relieved. Whatever she had wanted to give him, when he\n",
      "left her that morning, she had given him at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has landed,\" she said aloud. \"It is finished.\" Then, surging up,\n",
      "puffing slightly, old Mr. Carmichael stood beside her, looking like an\n",
      "old pagan god, shaggy, with weeds in his hair and the trident (it was\n",
      "only a French novel) in his hand. He stood by her on the edge of the\n",
      "lawn, swaying a little in his bulk and said, shading his eyes with his\n",
      "hand: \"They will have landed,\" and she felt that she had been right.\n",
      "They had not needed to speak. They had been thinking the same things\n",
      "and he had answered her without her asking him anything. He stood\n",
      "there as if he were spreading his hands over all the weakness and\n",
      "suffering of mankind; she thought he was surveying, tolerantly and\n",
      "compassionately, their final destiny. Now he has crowned the occasion,\n",
      "she thought, when his hand slowly fell, as if she had seen him let fall\n",
      "from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which,\n",
      "fluttering slowly, lay at length upon the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly, as if she were recalled by something over there, she turned to\n",
      "her canvas. There it was--her picture. Yes, with all its greens and\n",
      "blues, its lines running up and across, its attempt at something. It\n",
      "would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be destroyed. But\n",
      "what did that matter? she asked herself, taking up her brush again.\n",
      "She looked at the steps; they were empty; she looked at her canvas; it\n",
      "was blurred. With a sudden intensity, as if she saw it clear for a\n",
      "second, she drew a line there, in the centre. It was done; it was\n",
      "finished. Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue,\n",
      "I have had my vision.\n"
