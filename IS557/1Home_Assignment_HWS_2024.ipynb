The building has lots of floors, starting at `0` (zero, ground floor) up until `100` (top floor) as well as a basement from `A` (highest floor in the basement) to `G` (lowest floor in the basement). Moving downwards is free because of gravity, moving upwards costs `1` energy unit per floor. Assume that an idle elevator does not require any energy and that only moving between floors is relevant – starting/stopping does not consume more/less energy and elevator load is irrelevant as well.\n",
